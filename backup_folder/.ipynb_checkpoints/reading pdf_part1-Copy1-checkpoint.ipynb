      "THE BOY WHO LIVED\n",
      "Mr. and Mrs. Dursley, of number four, Privet Drive, were proud to say\n",
      "that they were perfectly normal, thank you very much. They were the last people\n",
      "you'd expect to be involved in anything strange or mysterious, because they just\n",
      "didn't hold with such nonsense.\n",
      "Mr. Dursley was the director of a firm called Grunnings, which made\n",
      "drills. He was a big, beefy man with hardly any neck, although he did have a\n",
      "very large mustache. Mrs. Dursley was thin and blonde and had nearly twice the\n",
      "usual amount of neck, which came in very useful as she spent so much of her\n",
      "time craning over garden fences, spying on the neighbors. The Dursleys had a\n",
      "small son called Dudley and in their opinion there was no finer boy anywhere.\n",
      "The Dursleys had everything they wanted, but they also had a secret, and\n",
      "their greatest fear was that somebody would discover it. They didn't think they\n",
      "could bear it if anyone found out about the Potters. Mrs. Potter was Mrs.\n",
      "Dursley's sister, but they hadn't met for several years; in fact, Mrs. Dursley\n",
      "pretended she didn't have a sister, because her sister and her good-for-nothing\n",
      "husband were as unDursleyish as it was possible to be. The Dursleys shuddered\n",
      "to think what the neighbors would say if the Potters arrived in the street. The\n",
      "Dursleys knew that the Potters had a small son, too, but they had never even\n",
      "seen him. This boy was another good reason for keeping the Potters away; they\n",
      "didn't want Dudley mixing with a child like that.\n",
      "When Mr. and Mrs. Dursley woke up on the dull, gray Tuesday our story\n",
      "starts, there was nothing about the cloudy sky outside to suggest that strange and\n",
      "mysterious things would soon be happening all over the country. Mr. Dursley\n",
      "hummed as he picked out his most boring tie for work, and Mrs. Dursley\n",
      "gossiped away happily as she wrestled a screaming Dudley into his high chair.\n",
      "None of them noticed a large, tawny owl flutter past the window.\n",
      "At half past eight, Mr. Dursley picked up his briefcase, pecked Mrs.\n",
      "Dursley on the cheek, and tried to kiss Dudley good-bye but missed, because\n",
      "Dudley was now having a tantrum and throwing his cereal at the walls.\n",
      "\"Little tyke,\" chortled Mr. Dursley as he left the house. He got into his car\n",
      "and backed out of number four's drive.\n",
      "It was on the corner of the street that he noticed the first sign of\n",
      "something peculiar a cat reading a map. For a second, Mr. Dursley didn't\n",
      "realize what he had seen - then he jerked his head around to look again. There\n",
      "was a tabby cat standing on the corner of Privet Drive, but there wasn't a map in\n",
      "sight. What could he have been thinking of? It must have been a trick of the\n",
      "light. Mr. Dursley blinked and stared at the cat. It stared back. As Mr. Dursley\n",
      "drove around the corner and up the road, he watched the cat in his mirror. It was\n",
      "now reading the sign that said Privet Driveno, looking at the sign; cats\n",
      "couldn't read maps or signs. Mr. Dursley gave himself a little shake and put the\n",
      "cat out of his mind. As he drove toward town he thought of nothing except a\n",
      "large order of drills he was hoping to get that day.\n",
      "But on the edge of town, drills were driven out of his mind by something\n",
      "else. As he sat in the usual morning traffic jam, he couldn't help noticing that\n",
      "there seemed to be a lot of strangely dressed people about. People in cloaks. Mr.\n",
      "Dursley couldn't bear people who dressed in funny clothes the getups you\n",
      "saw on young people! He supposed this was some stupid new fashion. He\n",
      "drummed his fingers on the steering wheel and his eyes fell on a huddle of these\n",
      "weirdos standing quite close by. They were whispering excitedly together. Mr.\n",
      "Dursley was enraged to see that a couple of them weren't young at all; why, that\n",
      "man had to be older than he was, and wearing an emerald-green cloak! The\n",
      "nerve of him! But then it struck Mr. Dursley that this was probably some silly\n",
      "stunt these people were obviously collecting for something...yes, that would\n",
      "be it. The traffic moved on and a few minutes later, Mr. Dursley arrived in the\n",
      "Grunnings parking lot, his mind back on drills.\n",
      "Mr. Dursley always sat with his back to the window in his office on the\n",
      "ninth floor. If he hadn't, he might have found it harder to concentrate on drills\n",
      "that morning. He didn't see the owls swooping past in broad daylight, though\n",
      "people down in the street did; they pointed and gazed open-mouthed as owl after\n",
      "owl sped overhead. Most of them had never seen an owl even at nighttime. Mr.\n",
      "Dursley, however, had a perfectly normal, owl-free morning. He yelled at five\n",
      "different people. He made several important telephone calls and shouted a bit\n",
      "more. He was in a very good mood until lunchtime, when he thought he'd stretch\n",
      "his legs and walk across the road to buy himself a bun from the bakery.\n",
      "He'd for gotten all about the people in cloaks until he passed a group of\n",
      "them next to the baker's. He eyed them angrily as he passed. He didn't know\n",
      "why, but they made him uneasy. This bunch were whispering excitedly, too, and\n",
      "he couldn't see a single collecting tin. It was on his way back past them,\n",
      "clutching a large doughnut in a bag, that he caught a few words of what they\n",
      "were saying.\n",
      "\"The Potters, that's right, that's what I heard\n",
      "\"\"\n",
      "66\n",
      "99\n",
      "yes, their son, Harry -\n",
      "Mr. Dursley stopped dead. Fear flooded him. He looked back at the\n",
      "whisperers as if he wanted to say something to them, but thought better of it.\n",
      "He dashed back across the road, hurried up to his office, snapped at his\n",
      "secretary not to disturb him, seized his telephone, and had almost finished\n",
      "dialing his home number when he changed his mind. He put the receiver back\n",
      "down and stroked his mustache, thinking...no, he was being stupid. Potter\n",
      "wasn't such an unusual name. He was sure there were lots of people called Potter\n",
      "who had a son called Harry. Come to think of it, he wasn't even sure his nephew\n",
      "was called Harry. He'd never even seen the boy. It might have been Harvey. Or\n",
      "Harold. There was no point in worrying Mrs. Dursley; she always got so upset at\n",
      "any mention of her sister. He didn't blame her - if he'd had a sister like that…..\n",
      "but all the same, those people in cloaks…...\n",
      "He found it a lot harder to concentrate on drills that afternoon and when\n",
      "he left the building at five o'clock, he was still so worried that he walked straight\n",
      "into someone just outside the door.\n",
      "\"Sorry,\" he grunted, as the tiny old man stumbled and almost fell. It was\n",
      "a few seconds before Mr. Dursley realized that the man was wearing a violet\n",
      "cloak. He didn't seem at all upset at being almost knocked to the ground. On the\n",
      "contrary, his face split into a wide smile and he said in a squeaky voice that made\n",
      "passersby stare, \"Don't be sorry, my dear sir, for nothing could upset me today!\n",
      "Rejoice, for You-Know-Who has gone at last! Even Muggles like yourself\n",
      "should be celebrating, this happy, happy day!\"\n",
      "And the old man hugged Mr. Dursley around the middle and walked off.\n",
      "Mr. Dursley stood rooted to the spot. He had been hugged by a complete\n",
      "stranger. He also thought he had been called a Muggle, whatever that was. He\n",
      "was rattled. He hurried to his car and set off for home, hoping he was imagining\n",
      "things, which he had never hoped before, because he didn't approve of\n",
      "imagination.\n",
      "As he pulled into the driveway of number four, the first thing he saw\n",
      "and it didn't improve his mood was the tabby cat he'd spotted that morning. It\n",
      "was now sitting on his garden wall. He was sure it was the same one; it had the\n",
      "same markings around its eyes.\n",
      "\"Shoo!\" said Mr. Dursley loudly.\n",
      "The cat didn't move. It just gave him a stern look. Was this normal cat\n",
      "behavior? Mr. Dursley wondered. Trying to pull himself together, he let himself\n",
      "into the house. He was still determined not to mention anything to his wife.\n",
      "Mrs. Dursley had had a nice, normal day. She told him over dinner all\n",
      "about Mrs. Next Door's problems with her daughter and how Dudley had\n",
      "learned a new word (\"Won't!\"). Mr. Dursley tried to act normally. When Dudley\n",
      "had been put to bed, he went into the living room in time to catch the last report\n",
      "on the evening news:\n",
      "\"And finally, bird-watchers everywhere have reported that the nation's\n",
      "owls have been behaving very unusually today. Although owls normally hunt at\n",
      "night and are hardly ever seen in daylight, there have been hundreds of sightings\n",
      "of these birds flying in every direction since sunrise. Experts are unable to\n",
      "explain why the owls have suddenly changed their sleeping pattern.\" The\n",
      "newscaster allowed himself a grin. “Most mysterious. And now, over to Jim\n",
      "McGuffin with the weather. Going to be any more showers of owls tonight,\n",
      "Jim?\"\n",
      "\"Well, Ted,\" said the weatherman, “I don't know about that, but it's not\n",
      "only the owls that have been acting oddly today. Viewers as far apart as Kent,\n",
      "Yorkshire, and Dundee have been phoning in to tell me that instead of the rain I\n",
      "promised yesterday, they've had a downpour of shooting stars! Perhaps people\n",
      "have been celebrating Bonfire Night early it's not until next week, folks! But\n",
      "I can promise a wet night tonight.\"\n",
      "Mr. Dursley sat frozen in his armchair. Shooting stars all over Britain?\n",
      "Owls flying by daylight? Mysterious people in cloaks all over the place? And a\n",
      "whisper, a whisper about the Potters....\n",
      "Mrs. Dursley came into the living room carrying two cups of tea. It was\n",
      "no good. He'd have to say something to her. He cleared his throat nervously. \"Er\n",
      "Petunia, dear you haven't heard from your sister lately, have you?\"\n",
      "As he had expected, Mrs. Dursley looked shocked and angry. After all,\n",
      "they normally pretended she didn't have a sister.\n",
      "\"No,\" she said sharply. \"Why?\"\n",
      "\"Funny stuff on the news,\" Mr. Dursley mumbled. \"Owls...shooting\n",
      "stars...and there were a lot of funny-looking people in town today....\"\n",
      "\"So?\" snapped Mrs. Dursley.\n",
      "\"Well, I just thought...maybe...it was something to do with...you\n",
      "know...her crowd.\"\n",
      "Mrs. Dursley sipped her tea through pursed lips. Mr. Dursley wondered\n",
      "whether he dared tell her he'd heard the name \"Potter.\" He decided he didn't\n",
      "dare. Instead he said, as casually as he could, “Their son he'd be about\n",
      "Dudley's age now, wouldn't he?\"\n",
      "\"I suppose so,\" said Mrs. Dursley stiffly.\n",
      "\"What's his name again? Howard, isn't it?\"\n",
      "\"Harry. Nasty, common name, if you ask me.\"\n",
      "\"Oh, yes,\" said Mr. Dursley, his heart sinking horribly. “Yes, I quite\n",
      "agree.\"\n",
      "He didn't say another word on the subject as they went upstairs to bed.\n",
      "While Mrs. Dursley was in the bathroom, Mr. Dursley crept to the bedroom\n",
      "window and peered down into the front garden. The cat was still there. It was\n",
      "staring down Privet Drive as though it were waiting for something.\n",
      "Was he imagining things? Could all this have anything to do with the\n",
      "Potters? If it did...if it got out that they were related to a pair of — well, he didn't\n",
      "think he could bear it.\n",
      "The Dursleys got into bed. Mrs. Dursley fell asleep quickly but Mr.\n",
      "Dursley lay awake, turning it all over in his mind. His last, comforting thought\n",
      "before he fell asleep was that even if the Potters were involved, there was no\n",
      "reason for them to come near him and Mrs. Dursley. The Potters knew very well\n",
      "what he and Petunia thought about them and their kind....He couldn't see how he\n",
      "and Petunia could get mixed up in anything that might be going on he\n",
      "yawned and turned over - it couldn't affect them....\n",
      "How very wrong he was.\n",
      "Mr. Dursley might have been drifting into an uneasy sleep, but the cat on\n",
      "the wall outside was showing no sign of sleepiness. It was sitting as still as a\n",
      "statue, its eyes fixed unblinkingly on the far corner of Privet Drive. It didn't so\n",
      "much as quiver when a car door slammed on the next street, nor when two owls\n",
      "swooped overhead. In fact, it was nearly midnight before the cat moved at all.\n",
      "A man appeared on the corner the cat had been watching, appeared so\n",
      "suddenly and silently you'd have thought he'd just popped out of the ground.\n",
      "The cat's tail twitched and its eyes narrowed.\n",
      "Nothing like this man had ever been seen on Privet Drive. He was tall,\n",
      "thin, and very old, judging by the silver of his hair and beard, which were both\n",
      "long enough to tuck into his belt. He was wearing long robes, a purple cloak that\n",
      "swept the ground, and high-heeled, buckled boots. His blue eyes were light,\n",
      "bright, and sparkling behind half-moon spectacles and his nose was very long\n",
      "and crooked, as though it had been broken at least twice. This man's name was\n",
      "Albus Dumbledore.\n",

      "street where everything from his name to his boots was unwelcome. He was\n",
      "busy rummaging in his cloak, looking for something. But he did seem to realize\n",
      "he was being watched, because he looked up suddenly at the cat, which was still\n",
      "staring at him from the other end of the street. For some reason, the sight of the\n",
      "cat seemed to amuse him. He chuckled and muttered, “I should have known.\"\n",
      "He found what he was looking for in his inside pocket. It seemed to be a\n",
      "silver cigarette lighter. He flicked it open, held it up in the air, and clicked it. The\n",
      "the next\n",
      "nearest street lamp went out with a little pop. He clicked it again\n",
      "lamp flickered into darkness. Twelve times he clicked the Put-Outer, until the\n",
      "only lights left on the whole street were two tiny pinpricks in the distance, which\n",
      "were the eyes of the cat watching him. If anyone looked out of their window\n",
      "now, even beady-eyed Mrs. Dursley, they wouldn't be able to see anything that\n",
      "was happening down on the pavement. Dumbledore slipped the Put-Outer back\n",
      "inside his cloak and set off down the street toward number four, where he sat\n",
      "down on the wall next to the cat. He didn't look at it, but after a moment he\n",
      "spoke to it.\n",
      "\"Fancy seeing you here, Professor McGonagall.\"\n",
      "He turned to smile at the tabby, but it had gone. Instead he was smiling at\n",
      "a rather severe-looking woman who was wearing square glasses exactly the\n",
      "shape of the markings the cat had had around its eyes. She, too, was wearing a\n",
      "cloak, an emerald one. Her black hair was drawn into a tight bun. She looked\n",
      "distinctly ruffled.\n",
      "\"How did you know it was me?\" she asked.\n",
      "\"My dear Professor, I've never seen a cat sit so stiffly.\"\n",
      "\"You'd be stiff if you'd been sitting on a brick wall all day,\" said\n",
      "Professor McGonagall.\n",
      "\"All day? When you could have been celebrating? I must have passed a\n",
      "dozen feasts and parties on my way here.\"\n",
      "Professor McGonagall sniffed angrily.\n",
      "\"Oh yes, I've celebrating, all right,\" she said impatiently. \"You'd think\n",
      "they'd be a bit more careful, but no -even the Muggles have noticed\n",
      "something's going on. It was on their news.\" She jerked her head back at the\n",
      "Dursleys' dark living-room window. \"I heard it. Flocks of owls...shooting\n",
      "stars...Well, they're not completely stupid. They were bound to notice\n",
      "something. Shooting stars down in Kent - I'll bet that was Dedalus Diggle. He\n",
      "never had much sense.\"\n",
      "\"You can't blame them,\" said Dumbledore gently. \"We've had precious\n",
      "little to celebrate for eleven years.\"\n",
      "\"I know that,\" said Professor McGonagall irritably. “But that's no reason\n",
      "to lose our heads. People are being downright careless, out on the streets in\n",
      "broad daylight, not even dressed in Muggle clothes, swapping rumors.\"\n",
      "She threw a sharp, sideways glance at Dumbledore here, as though\n",
      "hoping he was going to tell her something, but he didn't, so she went on. \"A fine\n",
      "thing it would be if, on the very day You-Know-Who seems to have disappeared\n",
      "at last, the Muggles found out about us all. I suppose he really has gone,\n",
      "Dumbledore?\"\n",
      "\"It certainly seems so,” said Dumbledore. \"We have much to be thankful\n",
      "for. Would you care for a lemon drop?\"\n",
      "\"A what?\"\n",
      "\"A lemon drop. They're a kind of Muggle sweet I'm rather fond of.\"\n",
      "\"No, thank you,\" said Professor McGonagall coldly, as though she didn't\n",
      "think this was the moment for lemon drops. “As I say, even if You-Know-Who\n",
      "has gone\n",
      "99\n",

      "trying to persuade people to call him by his proper name: Voldemort.\" Professor\n",
      "McGonagall flinched, but Dumbledore, who was unsticking two lemon drops,\n",
      "seemed not to notice. “It all gets so confusing if we keep saying 'You-Know-\n",

      "\"I know you haven't, said Professor McGonagall, sounding half\n",
      "exasperated, half admiring. \"But you're different. Everyone knows you're the\n",
      "only one You-Know- oh, all right, Voldemort, was frightened of.\"\n",
      "\"You flatter me,\" said Dumbledore calmly. \"Voldemort had powers I will\n",
      "never have.\"\n",
      "\"Only because you're too well — noble to use them.\"\n",
      "\"It's lucky it's dark. I haven't blushed so much since Madam Pomfrey\n",
      "told me she liked my new earmuffs.”\n",
      "Professor McGonagall shot a sharp look at Dumbledore and said \"The\n",
      "owls are nothing next to the rumors that are flying around. You know what\n",
      "they're saying? About why he's disappeared? About what finally stopped him?\"\n",
      "It seemed that Professor McGonagall had reached the point she was most\n",
      "anxious to discuss, the real reason she had been waiting on a cold, hard wall all\n",
      "day, for neither as a cat nor as a woman had she fixed Dumbledore with such a\n",
      "piercing stare as she did now. It was plain that whatever “everyone\" was saying,\n",
      "she was not going to believe it until Dumbledore told her it was true.\n",
      "Dumbledore, however, was choosing another lemon drop and did not answer.\n",
      "\"What they're saying,” she pressed on, “is that last night Voldemort\n",
      "turned up in Godric's Hollow. He went to find the Potters. The rumor is that Lily\n",

      "are that they're\n",

      "Dumbledore reached out and patted her on the shoulder. \"I know...I\n",

      "Professor McGonagall's voice trembled as she went on. \"That's not all.\n",
      "They're saying he tried to kill the Potter's son, Harry. But he couldn't. He\n",
      "couldn't kill that little boy. No one knows why, or how, but they're saying that\n",
      "when he couldn't kill Harry Potter, Voldemort's power somehow broke — and\n",
      "that's why he's gone.\"\n",

      "\"We can only guess.” said Dumbledore. “We may never know.\"\n",
      "Professor McGonagall pulled out a lace handkerchief and dabbed at her\n",
      "eyes beneath her spectacles. Dumbledore gave a great sniff as he took a golden\n",
      "watch from his pocket and examined it. It was a very odd watch. It had twelve\n",
      "hands but no numbers; instead, little planets were moving around the edge. It\n",
      "must have made sense to Dumbledore, though, because he put it back in his\n",
      "pocket and said, “Hagrid’s late. I suppose it was he who told you I'd be here, by\n",
      "the way?\"\n",
      "\"Yes,\" said Professor McGonagall. \"And I don't suppose you're going to\n",

      "two people who are less like us. And they've got this son - I saw him kicking\n",
      "his mother all the way up the street, screaming for sweets. Harry Potter come\n",
      "and live here!\"\n",
      "\"It's the best place for him,\" said Dumbledore firmly. “His aunt and\n",
      "uncle will be able to explain everything to him when he's older. I've written\n",
      "them a letter.”\n",
      "\"A letter?\" repeated Professor McGonagall faintly, sitting back down on\n",
      "the wall. \"Really, Dumbledore, you think you can explain all this in a letter?\n",
      "These people will never understand him! He'll be famous a legend - I\n",
      "wouldn't be surprised if today was known as Harry Potter day in the future-\n",
      "there will be books written about Harry every child in our world will know\n",
      "his name!\"\n",
      "\"Exactly.\" said Dumbledore, looking very seriously over the top of his\n",
      "half-moon glasses. \"It would be enough to turn any boy's head. Famous before\n",
      "he can walk and talk! Famous for something he won't even remember! Can you\n",
      "see how much better off he'll be, growing up away from all that until he's ready\n",
      "to take it?\"\n",
      "Professor McGonagall opened her mouth, changed her mind, swallowed,\n",
      "and then said, “Yes yes, you're right, of course. But how is the boy getting\n",
      "here, Dumbledore?\" She eyed his cloak suddenly as though she thought he might\n",

      "this?\"\n",
      "\"I would trust Hagrid with my life,\" said Dumbledore.\n",
      "\"I'm not saying his heart isn't in the right place,\" said Professor\n",
      "McGonagall grudgingly, \"but you can't pretend he's not careless. He does tend\n",
      "to what was that?\"\n",
      "A low rumbling sound had broken the silence around them. It grew\n",
      "steadily louder as they looked up and down the street for some sign of a\n",
      "headlight; it swelled to a roar as they both looked up at the sky — and a huge\n",
      "motorcycle fell out of the air and landed on the road in front of them.\n",
      "If the motorcycle was huge, it was nothing to the man sitting astride it.\n",
      "He was almost twice as tall as a normal man and at least five times as wide. He\n",
      "looked simply too big to be allowed, and so wild — long tangles of bushy black\n",
      "hair and beard hid most of his face, he had hands the size of trash can lids, and\n",
      "his feet in their leather boots were like baby dolphins. In his vast, muscular arms\n",
      "he was holding a bundle of blankets.\n",
      "\"Hagrid,\" said Dumbledore, sounding relieved. \"At last. And where did\n",
      "you get that motorcycle?\"\n",
      "\"Borrowed it, Professor Dumbledore, sir,\" said the giant, climbing\n",
      "carefully off the motorcycle as he spoke. \"Young Sirius Black lent it to me. I've\n",
      "got him, sir.\"\n",
      "\"No problems, were there?\"\n",
      "\"No, sir - house was almost destroyed, but I got him out all right before\n",
      "the Muggles started swarmin' around. He fell asleep as we was flyin' over\n",
      "Bristol.\"\n",
      "Dumbledore and Professor McGonagall bent forward over the bundle of\n",
      "blankets. Inside, just visible, was a baby boy, fast asleep. Under a tuft of jet-\n",
      "black hair over his forehead they could see a curiously shaped cut, like a bolt of\n",
      "lightning.\n",
      "\"Is that where?\" whispered Professor McGonagall.\n",
      "\"Yes,\" said Dumbledore. “He'll have that scar forever.\"\n",
      "\"Couldn't you do something about it, Dumbledore?\"\n",
      "\"Even if I could, I wouldn't. Scars can come in handy. I have one myself\n",
      "above my left knee that is a perfect map of the London Underground. Well-\n",
      "give him here, Hagrid we'd better get this over with.”\n",

      "house.\n",
      "-\n",
      "\"Could I could I say good-bye to him, sir?\" asked Hagrid. He bent his\n",
      "great, shaggy head over Harry and gave him what must have been a very\n",
      "scratchy, whiskery kiss. Then, suddenly, Hagrid let out a howl like a wounded\n",
      "dog.\n",
      "\"Shhh!\" hissed Professor McGonagall, \"You'll wake the Muggles!\"\n",
      "\"S-s-sorry,\" sobbed Hagrid, taking out a large, spotted handkerchief and\n",
      "burying his face in it. “But I c-c-can't stand it —Lily anʼ James dead\n",
      "an' poor\n",
      "little Harry off ter live with Muggles \"\n",
      "\"Yes, yes, it's all very sad, but get a grip on yourself, Hagrid, or we'll be\n",
      "found,\" Professor McGonagall whispered, patting Hagrid gingerly on the arm as\n",
      "Dumbledore stepped over the low garden wall and walked to the front door. He\n",
      "laid Harry gently on the doorstep, took a letter out of his cloak, tucked it inside\n",
      "Harry's blankets, and then came back to the other two. For a full minute the\n",
      "three of them stood and looked at the little bundle; Hagrid's shoulders shook,\n",
      "Professor McGonagall blinked furiously, and the twinkling light that usually\n",
      "shone from Dumbledore's eyes seemed to have gone out.\n",
      "\"Well,\" said Dumbledore finally, \"that's that. We've no business staying\n",
      "here. We may as well go and join the celebrations.\"\n",
      "“Yeah,” said Hagrid in a very muffled voice, “I'll be takin’ Sirius his bike\n",
      "back. G'night, Professor McGonagall Professor Dumbledore, sir.\"\n",
      "Wiping his streaming eyes on his jacket sleeve, Hagrid swung himself\n",
      "onto the motorcycle and kicked the engine into life; with a roar it rose into the\n",
      "air and off into the night.\n",
      "\"I shall see you soon, I expect, Professor McGonagall,\" said\n",
      "Dumbledore, nodding to her. Professor McGonagall blew her nose in reply.\n",
      "Dumbledore turned and walked back down the street. On the corner he\n",
      "stopped and took out the silver Put-Outer. He clicked it once, and twelve balls of\n",
      "light sped back to their street lamps so that Privet Drive glowed suddenly orange\n",
      "and he could make out a tabby cat slinking around the corner at the other end of\n",
      "the street. He could just see the bundle of blankets on the step of number four.\n",
      "\"Good luck, Harry,\" he murmured. He turned on his heel and with a\n",
      "swish of his cloak, he was gone.\n",
      "A breeze ruffled the neat hedges of Privet Drive, which lay silent and tidy\n",
      "under the inky sky, the very last place you would expect astonishing things to\n",
      "happen. Harry Potter rolled over inside his blankets without waking up. One\n",

      "milk bottles, nor that he would spend the next few weeks being prodded and\n",
      "pinched by his cousin Dudley....He couldn't know that at this very moment,\n",

      "he couldn't often catch him. Harry didn't look it, but he was very fast.\n",
      "Perhaps it had something to do with living in a dark cupboard, but Harry\n",
      "had always been small and skinny for his age. He looked even smaller and\n",
      "skinnier than he really was because all he had to wear were old clothes of\n",
      "Dudley's, and Dudley was about four times bigger than he was. Harry had a thin\n",

      "held together with a lot of Scotch tape because of all the times Dudley had\n",
      "punched him on the nose. The only thing Harry liked about his own appearance\n",
      "was a very thin scar on his forehead that was shaped like a bolt of lightning. He\n",

      "simply grew that way - all over the place.\n",
      "Harry was frying eggs by the time Dudley arrived in the kitchen with his\n",

      "THE DEATHDAY PARTY\n",
      "October arrived, spreading a damp chill over the\n",
      "grounds and into the castle. Madam Pomfrey, the\n",
      "nurse, was kept busy by a sudden spate of colds\n",
      "among the staff and students. Her Pepperup Potion\n",
      "worked instantly, though it left the drinker smoking\n",
      "at the ears for several hours afterward. Ginny\n",
      "Weasley, who had been looking pale, was bullied into\n",
      "taking some by Percy. The steam pouring from under\n",
      "her vivid hair gave the impression that her whole\n",

      "Raindrops the size of bullets thundered on the castle\n",

      "beds turned into muddy streams, and Hagrid's\n",
      "pumpkins swelled to the size of garden sheds. Oliver\n",
      "Wood's enthusiasm for regular training sessions,\n",
      "however, was not dampened, which was why Harry\n",

      "a few days before Halloween, returning to Gryffindor\n",
      "Tower, drenched to the skin and splattered with mud.\n",
      "Even aside from the rain and wind it hadn't been a\n",
      "happy practice session. Fred and George, who had\n",
      "Page | 136 Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets - J.K. Rowling\n",

      "As Harry squelched along the deserted corridor he\n",
      "came across somebody who looked just as\n",

      "their requirements ... half an inch, if that ...\"\n",
      "\"Hello, Nick,” said Harry.\n",
      "\"Hello, hello,\" said Nearly Headless Nick, starting and\n",
      "looking round. He wore a dashing, plumed hat on his\n",
      "long curly hair, and a tunic with a ruff, which\n",
      "concealed the fact that his neck was almost\n",
      "completely severed. He was pale as smoke, and Harry\n",
      "could see right through him to the dark sky and\n",
      "torrential rain outside.\n",
      "\"You look troubled, young Potter,\" said Nick, folding a\n",

      "\"Ah,\" Nearly Headless Nick waved an elegant hand, “a\n",

      "Decapitated-Podmore.\"\n",
      "Nearly Headless Nick took several deep breaths and\n",

      "ankles. He looked down and found himself gazing into\n",

      "all over the place\n",

      "\"Right,\" said Harry, backing away from the accusing\n",

      "his head, and his nose was unusually purple.\n",
      "\"Filth!\" he shouted, his jowls aquiver, his eyes\n",
      "popping alarmingly as he pointed at the muddy\n",

      "stood around the walls; from their labels, Harry could\n",
      "see that they contained details of every pupil Filch\n",
      "Page | 139 Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets - J.K. Rowling\n",
      "had ever punished. Fred and George Weasley had an\n",
      "entire drawer to themselves. A highly polished\n",

      "ridge of a vast hollow, a hollow that had been cleared\n",
      "of trees, so that the stars shone brightly onto the\n",
      "worst scene he had ever laid eyes on.\n",
      "Spiders. Not tiny spiders like those surging over the\n",

      "silently on the spot. Ron looked exactly like Harry felt.\n",
      "His mouth was stretched wide in a kind of silent\n",
      "scream and his eyes were popping.\n",

      "\"Aragog!\" it called. \"Aragog!\"\n",
      "And from the middle of the misty, domed web, a\n",
      "spider the size of a small elephant emerged, very\n",
      "slowly. There was gray in the black of his body and\n",
      "legs, and each of the eyes on his ugly, pincered head\n",
      "was milky white. He was blind.\n",
      "\"What is it?\" he said, clicking his pincers rapidly.\n",

      "\"Men,\" clicked the spider who had caught Harry.\n",

      "Harry thought of getting to his feet but decided\n",
      "against it; he didn't think his legs would support him.\n",

      "the castle. I come from a distant land. A traveler gave\n",

      "boy, but he cared for me, hidden in a cupboard in the\n",

      "Ron Weasley, who was one of Harry's best friends at Hogwarts, came from\n",

      "grunting snores of his enormous cousin, Dudley. It must be very late,\n",
      "Harry thought. His eyes were itching with tiredness. Perhaps he'd finish\n",

      "It was one o'clock in the morning. Harry's stomach gave a funny jolt. He\n",

      "reason to suppose they would remember this one.\n",
      "Harry walked across the dark room, past Hedwig's large, empty cage, to\n",
      "the open window. He leaned on the sill, the cool night air pleasant on\n",
      "his face after a long time under the blankets. Hedwig had been absent\n",
      "for two nights now. Harry wasn't worried about her: she'd been gone this\n",
      "long before. But he hoped she'd be back soon she was the only living\n",

      "always had been -- stubbornly untidy, whatever he did to it. The eyes\n",

      "pretending to Aunt Marge I go to that St. Whatsits --\"\n",
      "\"St. Brutus's Secure Center for Incurably Criminal Boys!\" bellowed Uncle\n",
      "Vernon, and Harry was pleased to hear a definite note of panic in Uncle\n",
      "Vernon's voice.\n",
      "\"Exactly,\" said Harry, looking calmly up into Uncle Vernon's large,\n",
      "purple face. \"It's a lot to remember. I'll have to make it sound\n",
      "convincing, won't I? What if I accidentally let something slip?\"\n",
      "\"You'll get the stuffing knocked out of you, won't you?\" roared Uncle\n",
      "Vernon, advancing on Harry with his fist raised. But Harry stood his\n",
      "ground.\n",
      "\"Knocking the stuffing out of me won't make Aunt Marge forget what I\n",
      "could tell her,\" he said grimly.\n",
      "Uncle Vernon stopped, his fist still raised, his face an ugly puce.\n",
      "\"But if you sign my permission form,\" Harry went on quickly, \"I swear\n",
      "I'll remember where I'm supposed to go to school, and I'll act like a\n",
      "Mug -- like I'm normal and everything.\"\n",
      "Harry could tell that Uncle Vernon was thinking it over, even if his\n",
      "teeth were bared and a vein was throbbing in his temple.\n",
      "\"Right,\" he snapped finally. \"I shall monitor your behavior carefully\n",
      "during Marge's visit. If, at the end of it, you've toed the line and\n",
      "kept to the story, I'll sign your ruddy form.\"\n",
      "16\n",
      "He wheeled around, pulled open the front door, and slammed it so hard\n",
      "that one of the little panes of glass at the top fell out.\n",
      "Harry didn't return to the kitchen. He went back upstairs to his\n",
      "bedroom. If he was going to act like a real Muggle, he'd better start\n",
      "now. Slowly and sadly he gathered up all his presents and his birthday\n",
      "cards and hid them under the loose floorboard with his homework. Then he\n",
      "went to Hedwig's cage. Errol seemed to have recovered; he and Hedwig\n",
      "were both asleep, heads under their wings. Harry sighed, then poked them\n",
      "both awake.\n",
      "\"Hedwig,\" he said gloomily, \"you're going to have to clear off for a\n",
      "week. Go with Errol. Ron'll look after you. I'll write him a note,\n",
      "explaining. And don't look at me like that\" -- Hedwig's large amber eyes\n",
      "were reproachful -- \"it's not my fault. It's the only way I'll be\n",
      "allowed to visit Hogsmeade with Ron and Hermione.\"\n",
      "Ten minutes later, Errol and Hedwig (who had a note to Ron bound to her\n",
      "leg) soared out of the window and out of sight. Harry, now feeling\n",
      "thoroughly miserable, put the empty cage away inside the wardrobe.\n",
      "But Harry didn't have long to brood. In next to no time, Aunt Petunia\n",
      "was shrieking up the stairs for Harry to come down and get ready to\n",
      "welcome their guest.\n",
      "\"Do something about your hair!\" Aunt Petunia snapped as he reached the\n",
      "hall.\n",
      "Harry couldn't see the point of trying to make his hair lie flat. Aunt\n",
      "Marge loved criticizing him, so the untidier he looked, the happier she\n",
      "would be.\n",
      "All too soon, there was a crunch of gravel outside as Uncle Vernon's car\n",
      "pulled back into the driveway, then the clunk of the car doors and\n",
      "footsteps on the garden path.\n",
      "\"Get the door!\" Aunt Petunia hissed at Harry.\n",
      "A feeling of great gloom in his stomach, Harry pulled the door open.\n",
      "17\n",
      "On the threshold stood Aunt Marge. She was very like Uncle Vernon:\n",
      "large, beefy, and purple- faced, she even had a mustache, though not as\n",
      "bushy as his. In one hand she held an enormous suitcase, and tucked\n",
      "under the other was an old and evil-tempered bulldog.\n",
      "\"Where's my Dudders?\" roared Aunt Marge. \"Where's my neffy-poo?\"\n",
      "Dudley came waddling down the hall, his blond hair plastered flat to his\n",
      "fat head, a bow tie just visible under his many chins. Aunt Marge thrust\n",
      "the suitcase into Harry's stomach, knocking the wind out of him, seized\n",
      "Dudley in a tight one-armed hug, and planted a large kiss on his cheek.\n",
      "Harry knew perfectly well that Dudley only put up with Aunt Marge's hugs\n",
      "because he was well paid for it, and sure enough, when they broke apart,\n",
      "Dudley had a crisp twenty-pound note clutched in his fat fist.\n",
      "\"Petunia!\" shouted Aunt Marge, striding past Harry as though he was a\n",
      "hat stand. Aunt Marge and Aunt Petunia kissed, or rather, Aunt Marge\n",
      "bumped her large jaw against Aunt Petunia's bony cheekbone.\n",
      "Uncle Vernon now came in, smiling jovially as he shut the door.\n",
      "\"Tea, Marge?\" he said. \"And what will Ripper take?\"\n",
      "\"Ripper can have some tea out of my saucer,\" said Aunt Marge as they all\n",
      "proceeded into the kitchen, leaving Harry alone in the hall with the\n",
      "suitcase. But Harry wasn't complaining; any excuse not to be with Aunt\n",
      "Marge was fine by him, so he began to heave the case upstairs into the\n",
      "spare bedroom, taking as long as he could.\n",
      "By the time he got back to the kitchen, Aunt Marge had been supplied\n",
      "with tea and fruitcake, and Ripper was lapping noisily in the corner.\n",
      "Harry saw Aunt Petunia wince slightly as specks of tea and drool flecked\n",
      "her clean floor. Aunt Petunia hated animals.\n",
      "\"Who's looking after the other dogs, Marge?\" Uncle Vernon asked.\n",
      "\"Oh, I've got Colonel Fubster managing them,\" boomed Aunt Marge. \"He's\n",
      "retired now, good for him to have something to do. But I couldn't leave\n",
      "18\n",
      "poor old Ripper. He pines if he's away from me.\"\n",
      "Ripper began to growl again as Harry sat down. This directed Aunt\n",
      "Marge's attention to Harry for the first time.\n",
      "\"So!\" she barked. \"Still here, are you?\"\n",
      "\"Yes,\" said Harry.\n",
      "\"Don't you say yes' in that ungrateful tone,\" Aunt Marge growled. \"It's\n",
      "damn good of Vernon and Petunia to keep you. Wouldn't have done it\n",
      "myself. You'd have gone straight to an orphanage if you'd been dumped on\n",
      "my doorstep.\"\n",
      "Harry was bursting to say that he'd rather live in an orphanage than\n",
      "with the Dursleys, but the thought of the Hogsmeade form stopped him. He\n",
      "forced his face into a painful smile.\n",
      "\"Don't you smirk at me!\" boomed Aunt Marge. \"I can see you haven't\n",
      "improved since I last saw you. I hoped school would knock some manners\n",
      "into you.\" She took a large gulp of tea, wiped her mustache, and said,\n",
      "\"Where is it that you send him, again, Vernon?\"\n",
      "\"St. Brutus's,\" said Uncle Vernon promptly. \"It's a first-rate\n",
      "institution for hopeless cases.\"\n",
      "\"I see,\" said Aunt Marge. \"Do they use the cane at St. Brutus's, boy?\"\n",
      "she barked across the table.\n",
      "\"Er --\"\n",
      "Uncle Vernon nodded curtly behind Aunt Marge's back.\n",
      "\"Yes,\" said Harry. Then, feeling he might as well do the thing properly,\n",
      "he added, \"all the time.\"\n",
      "\"Excellent,\" said Aunt Marge. \"I won't have this namby-pamby,\n",

      "\"Cool, sit!\" said Dean Thomas in amazement.\n",
      "\"Thank you, Dean,\" said Professor Lupin, putting his wand away again.\n",
      "\"Shall we proceed?\"\n",

      "he left, shutting the door with a snap.\n",
      "\"Now, then,\" said Professor Lupin, beckoning the class toward the end of\n",
      "the room, where there was nothing but an old wardrobe where the teachers\n",
      "kept their spare robes. As Professor Lupin went to stand next to it, the\n",
      "wardrobe gave a sudden wobble, banging off the wall.\n",
      "\"Nothing to worry about,\" said Professor Lupin calmly because a few\n",
      "people had jumped backward in alarm. \"There's a boggart in there.\"\n",
      "Most people seemed to feel that this was something to worry about.\n",
      "107\n",
      "Neville gave Professor Lupin a look of pure terror, and Seamus Finnigan\n",
      "eyed the now rattling doorknob apprehensively.\n",
      "\"Boggarts like dark, enclosed spaces,\" said Professor Lupin. \"Wardrobes,\n",
      "the gap beneath beds, the cupboards under sinks -- I've even met one\n",
      "that had lodged itself in a grandfather clock. This one moved in\n",
      "yesterday afternoon, and I asked the headmaster if the staff would leave\n",
      "it to give my third years some practice.\n",
      "\"So, the first question we must ask ourselves is, what is a boggart?\"\n",
      "Hermione put up her hand.\n",
      "\"It's a shape-shifter,\" she said. \"It can take the shape of whatever\n",
      "thinks will frighten us most.\"\n",
      "\"Couldn't have put it better myself,\" said Professor Lupin, and Hermione\n",
      "glowed. \"So the boggart sitting in the darkness within has not yet\n",
      "assumed a form. He does not yet know what will frighten the person on\n",
      "the other side of the door. Nobody knows what a boggart looks like when\n",
      "he is alone, but when I let him out, he will immediately become whatever\n",
      "each of us most fears.\n",
      "\"This means,\" said Professor Lupin, choosing to ignore Neville's 'mall\n",
      "sputter of terror, \"that we have a huge advantage over the boggart\n",
      "before we begin. Have you spotted it, Harry?\"\n",
      "Trying to answer a question with Hermione next to him, bobbing up and\n",
      "down on the balls of her feet with her hand in the air, was very\n",
      "off-putting, but Harry had a go.\n",
      "\"Er -- because there are so many of us, it won't know what shape it\n",
      "should be?\"\n",
      "\"Precisely,\" said Professor Lupin, and Hermione put her hand down,\n",
      "looking a little disappointed. \"It's always best to have com pany when\n",
      "you're dealing with a boggart. He becomes confused. Which should he\n",
      "become, a headless corpse or a flesh-eating slug? I once saw a boggart\n",
      "make that very mistake -- tried to frighten two people at once and\n",
      "turned himself into half a slug. Not remotely frightening.\n",
      "108\n",
      "\"The charm that repels a boggart is simple, yet it requires force of\n",
      "mind. You see, the thing that really finishes a boggart is laughter.\n",
      "What you need to do is force it to assume a shape that you find amusing.\n",
      "\"We will practice the charm without wands first. After me, please ...\n",
      "Riddikulus!\"\n",
      "\"Riddikulus!\" said the class together.\n",
      "\"Good,\" said Professor Lupin. \"Very good. But that was the easy part,\n",
      "I'm afraid. You see, the word alone is not enough. And this is where you\n",
      "come in, Neville.\"\n",
      "The wardrobe shook again, though not as much as Neville, who walked\n",
      "forward as though he were heading for the gallows.\n",
      "\"Right, Neville,\" said Professor Lupin. \"First things first: what would\n",
      "you say is the thing that frightens you most in the world?\"\n",
      "Neville's lips moved, but no noise came out.\n",
      "\"didn't catch that, Neville, sorry,\" said Professor Lupin cheerfully.\n",
      "Neville looked around rather wildly, as though begging someone to help\n",
      "him, then said, in barely more than a whisper, \"Professor Snape.\"\n",
      "Nearly everyone laughed. Even Neville grinned apologetically. Professor\n",
      "Lupin, however, looked thoughtful.\n",
      "\"Professor Snape... hmmm... Neville, I believe you live with your\n",
      "grandmother?\"\n",
      "\"Er -- yes,\" said Neville nervously. \"But -- I don't want the boggart to\n",
      "turn into her either.\"\n",
      "\"No, no, you misunderstand me,\" said Professor Lupin, now smiling. \"I\n",
      "wonder, could you tell us what sort of clothes your grandmother usually\n",
      "wears?\"\n",

      "\"And a handbag?\" prompted Professor Lupin.\n",
      "\"A big red one,\" said Neville.\n",
      "\"Right then,\" said Professor Lupin. \"Can you picture those clothes very\n",
      "clearly, Neville? Can you see them in your mind's eye?\"\n",
      "\"Yes,\" said Neville uncertainty, plainly wondering what was coming next.\n",
      "\"When the boggart bursts out of this wardrobe, Neville, and sees You, it\n",
      "will assume the form of Professor Snape,\" said Lupin. \"And You will\n",
      "raise your wand -- thus -- and cry 'Riddikulus' -- and concentrate hard\n",
      "on your grandmother's clothes. If all goes well, Professor Boggart Snape\n",
      "will be forced into that vulture-topped hat, and that green dress, with\n",
      "that big red handbag.\"\n",
      "There was a great shout of laughter. The wardrobe wobbled more\n",
      "violently.\n",
      "\"If Neville is successful, the boggart is likely to shift his attention\n",
      "to each of us in turn,\" said Professor Lupin. \"I would like all of you\n",
      "to take a moment now to think of the thing that scares you most, and\n",
      "imagine how you might force it to look comical....\"\n",
      "The room went quiet. Harry thought... 'What scared him most in the\n",

      "back, now, so Neville can get a clear shot --\"\n",
      "They all retreated, backed against the walls, leaving Neville alone\n",

      "vulture, and he was swinging a huge crimson handbag.\n",
      "There was a roar of laughter; the boggart paused, confused, and\n",

      "Parvati walked forward, her face set. Snape rounded on her. There was\n",

      "toward her very slowly, dragging its feet, its stiff arms rising --\n",
      "\"Riddikulus!\" cried Parvati.\n",
      "A bandage unraveled at the mummy's feet; it became entangled, fell face\n",
      "forward, and its head rolled off.\n",
      "\"Seamus!\" roared Professor Lupin.\n",
      "Seamus darted past Parvati.\n",
      "Crack! Where the mummy had been was a woman with floorlength black hair\n",
      "and a skeletal, green-tinged face a banshee. She opened her mouth\n",
      "wide and an unearthly sound filled the room, a long, wailing shriek that\n",
      "made the hair on Harry's head stand on end -- 'Riddikulus!\" shouted\n",
      "Seamus.\n",
      "The banshee made a rasping noise and clutched her throat; her voice was\n",
      "gone.\n",
      "Crack! The banshee turned into a rat, which chased its tail in a circle,\n",
      "then -- crack!- became a rattlesnake, which slithered and writhed before\n",
      "-- crack! -- becoming a single, bloody eyeball.\n",
      "'It's confused!\" shouted Lupin. \"We're getting there! Dean!\"\n",
      "Dean hurried forward.\n",
      "Crack! The eyeball became a severed hand, which flipped over and began\n",
      "to creep along the floor like a crab.\n",

      "Crack!\n",
      "Quite a few people screamed. A giant spider, six feet tall and covered\n",
      "in hair, was advancing on Ron, clicking its pincers menacingly. For a\n",
      "moment, Harry thought Ron had frozen. Then --\n",
      "\"Riddikulus!\" bellowed Ron, and the spider's legs vanished; it rolled\n",
      "over and over; Lavender Brown squealed and ran out of its way and it\n",
      "came to a halt at Harry's feet. He raised his wand, ready, but --\n",
      "\"Here!\" shouted Professor Lupin suddenly, hurrying forward. Crack!\n",
      "The legless spider had vanished. For a second, everyone looked wildly\n",
      "around to see where it was. Then they saw a silvery-white orb hanging in\n",
      "the air in front of Lupin, who said, \"Riddikulus!\" almosi lazily.\n",
      "Crack!\n",
      "\"Forward, Neville, and finish him off!\" said Lupin as the boggart landed\n",
      "on the floor as a cockroach. Crack! Snape was back. This time Neville\n",
      "charged forward looking determined.\n",
      "\"Riddikulus!\" he shouted, and they had a split second's view of Snape in\n",
      "his lacy dress before Neville let out a great \"Ha!\" of laughter, and the\n",
      "boggart exploded, burst into a thousand tiny wisps of smoke, and was\n",
      "gone.\n",
      "\"Excellent!\" cried Professor Lupin as the class broke into applause.\n",
      "\"Excellent) Neville. Well done, everyone.... Let me See... five points\n",
      "to Gryffindor for every person to tackle the boggart -- ten for Neville\n",
      "because he did it twice... and five each to Hermione and Harry.\"\n",
      "\"But I didn't do anything,\" said Harry.\n",
      "\"You and Hermione answered my questions correctly at the start of the\n",

      "for me... to be handed in on Monday. That will be all.\"\n",
      "113\n",
      "Talking excitedly, the class left the staffroom. Harry, however, wasn't\n",
      "feeling cheerful. Professor Lupin had deliberately stopped him from\n",
      "tackling the boggart. Why? Was it because he'd seen Harry collapse on\n",
      "the train, and thought he wasn't up to much? Had he thought Harry would\n",
      "pass out again?\n",
      "But no one else seemed to have noticed anything.\n",
      "\"Did you see me take that banshee?\" shouted Seamus. \"And the hand!\" said\n",

      "Lavender thoughtfully.\n",
      "\"That was the best Defense Against the Dark Arts lesson we've ever had,\n",
      "wasn't it?\" said Ron excitedly as they made their way back to the\n",
      "classroom to get their bags.\n",
      "\"He seems like a very good teacher,\" said Hermione approvingly. \"But I\n",
      "wish I could have had a turn with the boggart --\"\n",
      "\"What would it have been for you?\" said Ron, sniggering. \"A piece of\n",
      "homework that only got nine out of ten?\"\n",
      "CHAPTER EIGHT\n",
      "FLIGHT OF THE FAT FADY\n",
      "In no time at all, Defense Against the Dark Arts had become most\n",
      "people's favorite class. Only Draco Malfoy and his gang of Slytherins\n",
      "had anything bad to say about Professor Lupin.\n",
      "\"Look at the state of his robes,\" Malfoy would say in a loud whisper as\n",
      "Professor Lupin passed. \"He dresses like our old houseelf \"\n",
      "But no one else cared that Professor Lupin's robes were patched and\n",
      "frayed. His next few lessons were just as interesting as the first.\n",
      "114\n",
      "After boggarts, they studied Red Caps, nasty little goblin like\n",
      "creatures that lurked wherever there had been bloodshed: in the dungeons\n",
      "of castles and the potholes of deserted battlefields, waiting to\n",
      "bludgeon those who had gotten lost. From Red Caps they moved on to\n",
      "kappas, creepy. water-dwellers that looked like scaly monkeys, with\n",
      "webbed hands itching to strangle unwitting waders in their ponds.\n",
      "Harry only wished he was as happy with some of his other classes. Worst\n",
      "of all was Potions. Snape was in a particularly vindictive mood these\n",
      "days, and no one was in any doubt why. The story of the boggart assuming\n",
      "Snape's shape, and the way that Neville had dressed it in his\n",
      "grandmother's clothes, had traveled through the school like wildfire.\n",
      "Snape didn't seem to find it funny. His eyes flashed menacingly at the\n",
      "very mention of Professor Lupin's name, and he was bullying Neville\n",
      "worse than ever.\n",
      "Harry was also growing to dread the hours he spent in Professor\n",
      "Trelawney's stifling tower room, deciphering lopsided shapes and\n",
      "symbols, trying to ignore the way Professor Trelawney's enormous eyes\n",
      "filled with tears every time she looked at him. He couldn't like\n",
      "Professer Trelawney, even though she was treated with respect bordering\n",
      "on reverence by many of the class. Parvati Patil and Lavender Brown had\n",
      "taken to haunting Professor Trelawney's tower room at lunch times, and\n",
      "always returned with annoyingly superior looks on their faces, as though\n",
      "they knew things the others didn't. They had also started using hushed\n",
      "voices whenever they spoke to Harry, as though he were on his deathbed.\n",
      "Nobody really liked Care of Magical Creatures, which, after the\n",
      "action-packed first class, had become extremely dull. Hagrid seemed to\n",
      "have lost his confidence. They were now spending lesson after lesson\n",
      "learning how to look after flobberworms, which had to be some of the\n",
      "most boring creatures in existence.\n",
      "\"Why would anyone bother looking after them?\" said Ron, after yet\n",
      "another hour of poking shredded lettuce down the flobberworms' throats.\n",
      "At the start of October, however, Harry had something else to occupy\n",
      "him, something so enjoyable it more than made up for his unsatisfactory\n",
      "classes. The Quidditch season was approaching, and Oliver Wood, Captain\n",
      "of the Gryffindor team, called a meeting on Thursday evening to discuss\n",
      "115\n",
      "tactics for the new season.\n",
      "There were seven people on a Quidditch team: three Chasers, whose job it\n",
      "was to score goals by putting the Quaffle (a red, soccer-sized ball)\n",
      "through one of the fifty-foot-high hoops at each\n",
      "end of the field; two Beaters, who were equipped with heavy bats to\n",
      "repel the Bludgers (two heavy black balls that zoomed around trying to\n",
      "attack the players); a Keeper, who defended the goal\n",
      "posts, and the Seeker, who had the hardest job of all, that of catching\n",
      "the Golden Snitch, a tiny, winged, walnut-sized ball, whose capture\n",
      "ended the game and earned the Seeker's team an extra one hundred and\n",
      "fifty points.\n",

      "year at Hogwarts. There was a quiet sort of desperation in his voice a's\n",

      "\"This is our last chance\n",
      "my last chance\n",
      "to win the Quidditch Cup,\"\n",

      "\"Gryffindor hasn't won for seven years now. Okay, so we've had the worst\n",
      "luck in the world -- injuries -- then the tournamentgetting called off\n",
      "last year Wood swallowed, as though the memory still brought a lump to\n",
      "his throat. \"But we also know we've got the\n",
      "best-ruddy-team-in-the-school,\" he said, punching a fist into his other\n",
      "hand, the old manic glint back in his eye. \"We've got three superb\n",

      "Wood pointed at Alicia Spinner, Angelina Johnson, and Katie Bell.\n",
      "\"We've got two unbeatable Beaters.\"\n",
      "\"Stop it, Oliver, you're embarrassing us,\" said Fred and George Weasley\n",
      "together, pretending to blush.\n",
      "\"And we've got a Seeker who has never failed to win us a match!\" Wood\n",
      "116\n",
      "rumbled, glaring at Harry with a kind of furious pride. \"And me,\" he\n",

      "\"Spanking good Keeper,\" said Fred.\n",
      "\"The point is,\" Wood went on, resuming his pacing, \"the Quidditch Cup\n",
      "should have had our name on it these last two years. Ever since Harry\n",
      "joined the team, I've thought the thing was in the bag. But we haven't\n",
      "got it, and this year's the last chance we'll get to finally see our\n",

      "\"Definitely,\" said Harry.\n",
      "Full of determination, the team started training sessions, three\n",
      "evenings a week. The weather was getting colder and wetter, the nights\n",
      "darker, but no amount of mud, wind, or rain could tarnish Harry's\n",
      "wonderful vision of finally winning the huge, silver Quidditch Cup.\n",
      "Harry returned to the Gryffindor common room one evening after training,\n",
      "cold and stiff but pleased with the way practice had gone, to find the\n",
      "room buzzing excitedly.\n",
      "\"What's happened?\", he asked Ron and Hermione, who were sitting in two\n",
      "of the best chairs by the fireside and completing some star charts for\n",
      "Astronomy.\n",
      "\"First Hogsmeade weekend,\" said Ron, pointing at a notice that had\n",
      "appeared on the battered old bulletin board. \"End of October.\n",
      "Halloween.\"\n",
      "\"Excellent,\" said Fred, who had followed Harry through the portrait\n",
      "hole. \"I need to visit Zonko's. I'm nearly out of Stink Pellets.\"\n",
      "117\n",
      "Harry threw himself into a chair beside Ron, his high spirits ebbing\n",
      "away. Hermione seemed to read his mind.\n",
      "\"Harry, I'm sure you'll be able to go next time,\" she said. \"They're\n",
      "bound to catch Black soon. He's been sighted once already.\"\n",
      "\"Black's not fool enough to try anything in Hogsmeade,\" said Ron. \"Ask\n",
      "McGonagall if you can go this time, Harry. The next one might not be for\n",
      "ages --\"\n",
      "\"Ron!\" said Hermione. \"Harry's supposed to stay in school-\"\n",
      "\"He can't be the only third year left behind,\" said Ron. \"Ask\n",
      "McGonagall, go on, Harry --\"\n",
      "\"Yeah, I think I will,\" said Harry, making up his mind.\n",
      "Hermione opened her mouth to argue, but at that moment Crookshanks leapt\n",
      "lightly onto her lap. A large, dead spider was dangling from his mouth.\n",
      "\"Does he have to eat that in front of us?\" said Ron, scowling.\n",
      "\"Clever Crookshanks, did you catch that all by yourself?\" said Hermione.\n",
      "Crookshanks; slowly chewed up the spider, his yellow eyes fixed\n",
      "insolently on Ron.\n",
      "\"Just keep him over there, that's all,\" said Ron irritably, turning back\n",
      "to his star chart. \"I've got Scabbers asleep in my bag.\"\n",
      "Harry yawned. He really wanted to go to bed, but he still had his own\n",
      "star chart to complete. He pulled his bag toward him, took out\n",
      "parchment, ink, and quill, and started work.\n",
      "\"You can copy mine, if you like,\" said Ron, labeling his last star with\n",
      "a flourish and shoving the chart toward Harry.\n",
      "Hermione, who disapproved of copying, pursed her lips but didn't say\n",
      "anything. Crookshanks was still staring unblinkingly at Ron, flicking\n",

      "pressed against the glass, pulling faces and flexing its long, spindly\n",
      "fingers.\n",
      "\"Water demon,\" said Lupin, surveying the grindylow thoughtfully. \"We\n",

      "Something of Harry's thoughts seemed to have shown on his face, because\n",
      "Lupin said, \"Anything worrying you, Harry?\"\n",
      "\"No,\" Harry lied. He drank a bit of tea and watched the grindylow\n",
      "brandishing a fist at him. \"Yes,\" he said suddenly, putting his tea down\n",
      "on Lupin's desk. \"You know that day we fought the boggart?\"\n",
      "\"Yes,\" said Lupin slowly.\n",
      "\"Why didn't you let me fight it?\" said Harry abruptly.\n",
      "Lupin raised his eyebrows.\n",
      "\"I would have thought that was obvious, Harry,\" he said, sounding\n",

      "Harry, who had expected Lupin to deny that he'd done any such thing, was\n",

      "\"Why?\" he said again.\n",
      "\"Well,\" said Lupin, frowning slightly, \"I assumed that if the boggart\n",
      "faced you, it would assume the shape of Lord Voldemort.\"\n",
      "Harry stared. Not only was this the last answer he'd expected, but Lupin\n",
      "had said Voldemort's name. The only person Harry had ever heard say the\n",
      "name aloud (apart from himself) was Professor Dumbledore.\n",
      "\"Clearly, I was wrong,\" said Lupin, still frowning at Harry. \"But I\n",
      "didn't think it a good idea for Lord Voldemort to materialize in the\n",
      "staffroom. I imagined that people would panic.\"\n",
      "\"I didn't think of Voldemort,\" said Harry honestly. \"I -- I remembered\n",

      "smiled slightly at the look of surprise on Harry's face. \"That suggests\n",

      "\"So you've been thinking that I didn't believe you capable of fighting\n",

      "\"Well... yeah,\" said Harry. He was suddenly feeling a lot happier.\n",
      "\"Professor Lupin, you know the dementors --\"\n",
      "He was interrupted by a knock on the door.\n",
      "\"Come in,\" called Lupin.\n",
      "The door opened, and in came Snape. He was carrying a goblet, which was\n",
      "smoking faintly, and stopped at the sight of Harry, his black eyes\n",
      "narrowing.\n",
      "\"Ah, Severus,\" said Lupin, smiling. \"Thanks very much. Could you leave\n",
      "it here on the desk for me?\"\n",
      "Snape set down the smoking goblet, his eyes wandering between Harry and\n",
      "Lupin.\n",

      "directly, Lupin.\"\n",
      "\"Yes, Yes, I will,\" said Lupin.\n",
      "\"I made an entire cauldronful,\" Snape continued. \"If you need more.\n",
      "\"I should probably take some again tomorrow. Thanks very much, Severus.\"\n",
      "\"Not at all,\" said Snape, but there was a look in his eye Harry didn't\n",

      "useless,\" he added, taking a sip and shuddering.\n",
      "\"Why --?\" Harry began. Lupin looked at him and answered the unfinished\n",
      "question.\n",
      "\"I've been feeling a bit off-color,\" he said. \"This potion is the only\n",

      "The food was delicious; even Hermione and Ron, who were full to bursting\n",
      "with Honeydukes sweets, managed second helpings of everything. Harry\n",
      "kept glancing at the staff table. Professor Lupin\n",
      "looked cheerful and as well as he ever did; he was talking animatedly to\n",
      "tiny little Professor Flitwick, the Charms teacher. Harry moved his eyes\n",
      "along the table, to the place where Snape sat. Was he imagining it, or\n",
      "were Snape's eyes flickering toward Lupin more often than was natural?\n",
      "The feast finished with an entertainment provided by the Hogwarts\n",

      "students.\n",
      "\"Why isn't anyone going in?\" said Ron curiously.\n",

      "And then a silence fell over the crowd, from the front first, so that a\n",

      "suddenly sharp voice, \"Somebody get Professor Dumbledore. Quick.\"\n",
      "People's heads turned; those at the back were standing on tiptoe.\n",

      "A moment later, Professor Dumbledore was there, sweeping toward the\n",

      "Harry, Ron, and Hermione moved closer to see what the trouble was.\n",
      "\"Oh, my --\" Hermione grabbed Harry's arm.\n",
      "The Fat Lady had vanished from her portrait, which had been slashed so\n",
      "viciously that strips of canvas littered the floor; great chunks of it\n",
      "had been torn away completely.\n",
      "Dumbledore took one quick look at the ruined painting and turned, his\n",
      "eyes somber, to see Professors McGonagall, Lupin, and Snape hurrying\n",
      "toward him.\n",
      "\"We need to find her,\" said Dumbledore. \"Professor McGonagall, please go\n",
      "to Mr. Filch at once and tell him to search every painting in the castle\n",
      "for the Fat Lady.\"\n",

      "It was Peeves the Poltergeist, bobbing over the crowd and looking\n",
      "delighted, as he always did, at the sight of wreckage or worry.\n",
      "\"What do you mean, Peeves?\" said Dumbledore calmly, and Peeves's grin\n",
      "faded a little. He didn't dare taunt Dumbledore. Instead he adopted an\n",
      "oily voice that was no better than his cackle. \"Ashamed, Your Headship,\n",
      "sit. Doesn't want to be seen. She's a horrible mess. Saw her running\n",
      "through the landscape up on the fourth floor, sir, dodging between the\n",
      "trees. Crying something dreadful,\" he said happily. \"Poor thing,\" he\n",
      "added unconvincingly.\n",
      "\"Did she say who did it?\" said Dumbledore quietly.\n",
      "\"Oh yes, Professorhead,\" said Peeves, with the air of one cradling a\n",
      "132\n",
      "large bombshell in his arms. \"He got very angry when she wouldn't let\n",
      "him in, you see.\" Peeves flipped over and grinned at Dumbledore from\n",

      "Hermione shuddered.\n",
      "All around them, people were asking one another the same question: \"How\n",

      "\"The lights are going out now!\" Percy shouted. \"I want everyone in their\n",

      "The candles all went out at once. The only light now came from the\n",

      "134\n",
      "scattered with stars. What with that, and the whispering that still\n",

      "Once every hour, a teacher would reappear in the hall to check that\n",

      "\"And the Fat Lady, sir?\"\n",

      "restore her.\"\n",
      "Harry heard the door of the hall creak open again, and more footsteps.\n",
      "\"Headmaster?\" It was Snape. Harry kept quite still, listening hard. \"The\n",

      "\"Oh yes,\" said Dumbledore coldly. \"But I'm afraid no dementor will cross\n",
      "the threshold of this castle while I am headmaster.\"\n",
      "Percy looked slightly abashed. Dumbledore left the hall, walking quickly\n",
      "and quietly. Snape stood for a moment, watching the headmaster with an\n",

      "Harry glanced sideways at Ron and Hermione. Both of them had their eyes\n",
      "open too, reflecting the starry ceiling.\n",

      "What was all that about?\" Ron mouthed.\n",
      "The school talked of nothing but Sirius Black for the next few days. The\n",
      "theories about how he had entered the castle became wilder and wilder;\n",
      "Hannah Abbott, from Hufflepuff, spent much of their next Herbology class\n",
      "telling anyone who'd listen that Black could turn into a flowering\n",
      "shrub.\n",
      "The Fat Lady's ripped canvas had been taken off the wall and\n",
      "Replaced with the portrait of Sir Cadogan and his fat gray pony. Nobody\n",
      "was very happy about this. Sir Cadogan spent half his time challenging\n",
      "people to duels, and the rest thinking up ridiculously complicated\n",
      "passwords, which he changed at least twice a day.\n",
      "\"He's a complete lunatic,\" said Seamus Finnigan angrily to Percy. \"Can't\n",
      "we get anyone else?\"\n",
      "\"None of the other pictures wanted the job,\" said Percy. \"Frightened of\n",

      "to volunteer.\"\n",
      "Sir Cadogan, however, was the least of Harry's worries. He was now being\n",
      "closely watched. Teachers found excuses to walk along corridors with\n",
      "him, and Percy Weasley (acting, Harry suspected, on his mother's orders)\n",
      "was tailing him everywhere like an extremely pompous guard dog. To cap\n",
      "it all, Professor McGonagall summoned Harry into her office, with such a\n",
      "somber expression on her face Harry thought someone must have died.\n",
      "\"There's no point hiding it from you any longer, Potter,\" she said in a\n",
      "very serious voice. \"I know this will come as a shock to you, but Sirius\n",
      "Black --\"\n",
      "\"I know he's after me,\" said Harry wearily. \"I heard Ron's dad telling\n",
      "his mum. Mr. Weasley works for the Ministry of Magic.\"\n",
      "Professor McGonagall seemed very taken aback. She stared at Harry for a\n",

      "to train, Professor!\"\n",
      "Professor McGonagall considered him intently. Harry knew she was deeply\n",
      "interested in the Gryffindor team's prospects; it had been she, after\n",
      "all, who'd suggested him as Seeker in the first Place. He waited,\n",
      "holding his breath.\n",
      "\"Hmm...\" Professor McGonagall stood up and stared out of the window at\n",

      "Saturday's match, Oliver Wood gave his team some unwelcome news.\n",
      "\"We're not playing Slytherin!\" he told them, looking very angry.\n",
      "\"Flint's just been to see me. We're playing Hufflepuff instead.\"\n",
      "\"Why?\" chorused the rest of the team.\n",
      "\"Flint's excuse is that their Seeker's arm's still injured,\" said Wood,\n",
      "grinding his teeth furiously. \"But it's obvious why they're doing it.\n",
      "Don't want to play in this weather. Think it'll damage their\n",
      "chances....\"\n",
      "There had been strong winds and heavy rain all day, and as Wood spoke,\n",
      "they heard a distant rumble of thunder.\n",
      "\"There's nothing wrong with Malfoy's arm!\" said Harry furiously. \"He's\n",
      "faking it!\"\n",
      "\"I know that, but we can't prove it,\" said Wood bitterly, \"And we've\n",
      "been practicing all those moves assuming we're playing Slytherin, and\n",
      "138\n",
      "instead it's Hufflepuff, and their style's quite different. They've got\n",
      "a new Captain and Seeker, Cedric Diggory --\"\n",
      "Angelina, Alicia, and Katie suddenly giggled.\n",
      "\"What?\" said Wood, frowning at this lighthearted behavior.\n",
      "\"He's that tall, good-looking one, isn't he?\" said Angelina.\n",
      "\"Strong and silent,\" said Katie, and they started to giggle again.\n",
      "\"He's only silent because he's too thick to string two words together,\"\n",
      "said Fred impatiently. \"I don't know why you're worried, Oliver,\n",

      "outside pounded the windows.\n",

      "Harry woke extremely early the next morning; so early that it was till\n",
      "dark. For a moment he thought the roaring of the wind had woken him.\n",
      "Then he felt a cold breeze on the back of his neck and sat bolt upright\n",
      "-- Peeves the Poltergeist had been floating next to him, blowing hard in\n",
      "his ear.\n",
      "\"What did you do that for?\" said Harry furiously. Peeves puffed out his\n",
      "cheeks, blew hard, and zoomed backward out of the room, cackling.\n",
      "Harry fumbled for his alarm clock and looked at it. It was half past\n",
      "four. Cursing Peeves, he rolled over and tried to get back to sleep, but\n",
      "it very difficult, now that he was awake, to ignore the sounds of\n",
      "the thunder rumbling overhead, the pounding of the wind against the\n",
      "castle walls, and the distant creaking of the trees in the Forbidden\n",
      "Forest. In a few hours he would be out on the Quidditch field, battling\n",
      "through that gale. Finally, he gave up any thought of more sleep, got\n",
      "up, dressed, picked up his Nimbus Two Thousand, and walked quietly out\n",
      "of the dormitory.\n",
      "143\n",
      "As Harry opened the door, something brushed against his leg. He bent\n",
      "down just in time to grab Crookshanks by the end of his bushy tail and\n",
      "drag him outside.\n",
      "\"You know, I reckon Ron was right about you,\" Harry told Crookshanks\n",
      "suspiciously. \"There are plenty of mice around this place -- go and\n",

      "The noise of the storm was even louder in the common roorn. Harry knew\n",
      "better than to think the match would be canceled; Quidditch matches\n",
      "weren't called off for trifles like thunderstorms. Nevertheless, he was\n",
      "starting to feel very apprehensive. Wood had pointed out Cedric Diggory\n",
      "to him in the corridor; Diggory was a fifth year and a lot bigger than\n",
      "Harry. Seekers were usually light\n",
      "and speedy, but Diggory's weight would be an advantage in this weather\n",
      "because he was less likely to be blown off course.\n",
      "Harry whiled away the hours until dawn in front of the fire, getting up\n",
      "every now and then to stop Crookshanks from sneaking up\n",
      "the boys, staircase again. At long last Harry thought it must be time\n",
      "for breakfast, so he headed through the portrait hole alone.\n",
      "\"Stand and fight, you mangy cur!\" yelled Sir Cadogan.\n",
      "\"Oh, shut up,\" Harry yawned.\n",
      "He revived a bit over a large bowl of porridge, and by the time he'd\n",
      "started on toast, the rest of the team had turned up.\n",
      "\"It's going to be a tough one,\" said Wood, who wasn't eating anything.\n",
      "\"Stop worrying, Oliver,\" said Alicia soothingly, \"we don't mind a bit of\n",
      "rain.\"\n",
      "But it was considerably more than a bit of rain. Such was the popularity\n",
      "of Quidditch that the whole school turned out to watch the match as\n",
      "usual, but they ran down the lawns toward the Quidditch field, heads\n",
      "144\n",
      "bowed against the ferocious wind, umbrellas being whipped out of their\n",
      "hands as they went. just before he entered the locker room, Harry saw\n",
      "Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle, laughing and pointing at him from under an\n",
      "enormous umbrella on their way to the stadium.\n",
      "The team changed into their scarlet robes and waited for Wood's usual\n",
      "pre-match pep talk, but it didn't come. He tried to speak several times,\n",
      "made an odd gulping noise, then shook his head hopelessly and beckoned\n",
      "them to follow him.\n",
      "The wind was so strong that they staggered sideways as they walked out\n",
      "onto the field. If the crowd was cheering, they couldn't hear it over\n",
      "the fresh rolls of thunder. Rain was splattering over Harry's glasses.\n",
      "How on earth was he going to see the Snitch in this?\n",
      "The Hufflepuffs were approaching from the opposite side of the field,\n",
      "wearing canary-yellow robes. The Captains walked up to each other and\n",
      "shook hands; Diggory smiled at Wood but Wood no, looked as though he had\n",
      "lockjaw and merely nodded. Harry saw Madam Hooch's mouth form the words,\n",
      "\"Mount Your brooms.,, He pulled his right foot out of the mud with a\n",
      "squelch and swung it over his Nimbus Two Thousand. Madam Hooch put her\n",
      "whistle to her lips and gave it a blast that sounded shrill and distant\n",
      "they were off\n",
      "Harry rose fast, but his Nimbus was swerving slightly with the wind. He\n",
      "held it as steady as he could and turned, squinting into the rain.\n",
      "Within five minutes Harry was soaked to his skin and frozen, hardly able\n",
      "to see his teammates, let alone the tiny Snitch. He flew backward and\n",
      "forward across the field past blurred red and yellow shapes, with no\n",
      "idea of what was happening in the rest of the game. He couldn't hear the\n",
      "commentary over the wind. The crowd was hidden beneath a sea of cloaks\n",
      "and battered umbrellas. Twice Harry came very close to being unseated by\n",
      "a Bludger; his vision was so clouded by the rain on his glasses he\n",
      "hadn't seen them coming.\n",
      "He lost track of time. It was getting harder and harder to hold his\n",
      "broom straight. The sky was getting darker, as though night had decided\n",
      "to come early. Twice Harry nearly hit another player, without knowing\n",
      "whether it was a teammate or opponent; everyone was now so wet, and the\n",
      "145\n",
      "rain so thick, he could hardly tell them apart....\n",
      "With the first flash of lightning came the sound of Madam Hooch's\n",
      "whistle; Harry could just see the outline of Wood through the thick\n",
      "rain, gesturing him to the ground. The whole team splashed down into the\n",
      "mud.\n",
      "\"I called for time-out!\" Wood roared at his team. \"Come on, under here\n",
      "11\n",
      "They huddled at the edge of the field under a large umbrella; Harry took\n",
      "off his glasses and wiped them hurriedly on his robes.\n",
      "\"What's the score?\"\n",
      "\"We're fifty points up,\" said Wood, \"but unless we get the Snitch soon,\n",
      "we'll be playing into the night.\"\n",
      "\"I've got no chance with these on,\" Harry said exasperatedly, waving his\n",
      "glasses.\n",
      "At that very moment, Hermione appeared at his shoulder; she was holding\n",
      "her cloak over her head and was, inexplicably, beaming.\n",
      "\"I've had an idea, Harry! Give me your glasses, quick!\"\n",
      "He handed them to her, and as the team watched in amazement, Hermione\n",
      "tapped them with her wand and said, \"Impervius!\"\n",
      "\"There!\" she said, handing them back to Harry. \"They'll repel water!\"\n",
      "Wood looked as though he could have kissed her.\n",
      "\"Brilliant!\" he called hoarsely after her as she disappeared into the\n",
      "crowd. \"Okay, team, let's go for it!\"\n",
      "Hermione's spell had done the trick. Harry was still numb with cold,\n",
      "still wetter than he'd ever been in his life, but he could see. Full of\n",
      "fresh determination, he urged his broom through the turbulent air,\n",
      "staring in every direction for the Snitch, avoiding a Bludger, ducking\n",
      "146\n",
      "beneath Diggory, who was streaking in the opposite direction....\n",
      "There was another clap of thunder, followed immediately by forked\n",
      "lightning. This was getting more and more dangerous. Harry needed to get\n",
      "the Snitch quickly -\n",
      "He turned, intending to head back toward the middle of the field, but at\n",
      "that moment, another flash of lightning illuminated the stands, and\n",
      "Harry saw something that distracted him completely, the silhouette of\n",
      "an enormous shaggy black dog, clearly imprinted against the sky,\n",
      "motionless in the topmost, empty row of seats.\n",
      "Harry's numb hands slipped on the broom handle and his Nimbus dropped a\n",
      "few feet. Shaking his sodden bangs out of his eyes, he squinted back\n",
      "into the stands. The dog had vanished.\n",
      "\"Harry!\" came Wood's anguished yell from the Gryffindor goal posts.\n",
      "\"Harry, behind you!\"\n",
      "Harry looked wildly around. Cedric Diggory was pelting up the field, and\n",
      "a tiny speck of gold was shimmering in the rain-filled air between them\n",
      "With a jolt of panic, Harry threw himself flat to the broornhandle and\n",
      "zoomed toward the Snitch.\n",
      "\"Come on!\" he growled at his Nimbus as the rain whipped his face.\n",
      "'Taster!\"\n",
      "But something odd was happening. An eerie silence was falling across the\n",
      "stadium. The wind, though as strong as ever, was forgetting to roar. It\n",
      "was as though someone had turned off the sound, as though Harry had gone\n",
      "suddenly deaf -- what was going on?\n",
      "And then a horribly familiar wave of cold swept over him, inside him,\n",
      "just as he became aware of something moving on the field below...\n",
      "Before he'd had time to think, Harry had taken his eyes off the Snitch\n",
      "and looked down.\n",
      "147\n",
      "At least a hundred dementors, their hidden faces pointing up at him,\n",
      "were standing beneath him. It was as though freezing water were rising\n",
      "in his chest, cutting at his insides. And then he heard it again....\n",
      "Someone was screaming, screaming inside his head... a woman...\n",
      "\"Not Harry, not Harry, please not Harry!\"\n",
      "\"Stand aside, you silly girl... stand aside, now.\n",
      "\"Not Harry, please no, take me, kill me instead --\"\n",
      "Numbing, swirling white mist was filling Harry's brain.... What was he\n",
      "doing? Why was he flying? He needed to help her... She was going to\n",
      "die.... She was going to be murdered....\n",
      "He was falling, falling through the icy mist.\n",
      "\"Not Harry! Please... have mercy... have mercy....\n",

      "whatsoever. He didn't have a clue where he was, or how he'd got there,\n",
      "or what he'd been doing before he got there. All he knew was that every\n",

      "frowning slightly.\n",
      "The babble broke out again.\n",
      "\"Yes, but he said we were really behind he wouldn't listen --\"\n",

      "\"Oh no,\" said Hermione, looking very disappointed. \"I've already\n",
      "finished it!\"\n",
      "They had a very enjoyable lesson. Professor Lupin had brought along a\n",
      "glass box containing a hinkypunk, a little one-legged creature who\n",
      "looked as though he were made of wisps of smoke, rather frail and\n",
      "harmless looking.\n",
      "\"Lures travelers into bogs,\" said Professor Lupin as they took notes.\n",
      "\"You notice the lantern dangling from his hand? Hops ahead -people\n",
      "follow the light -- then --\"\n",
      "The hinkypunk made a horrible squelching noise against the glass.\n",
      "When the bell rang, everyone gathered up their things and headed for the\n",
      "door, Harry among them, but -\n",
      "\"Wait a moment, Harry,\" Lupin called. \"I'd like a word.\"\n",
      "Harry doubled back and watched Professor Lupin covering the hinkypunk's\n",
      "box with a cloth.\n",
      "\"I heard about the match,\" said Lupin, turning back to his desk and\n",
      "starting to pile books into his briefcase, \"and I'm sorry about your\n",
      "broomstick. Is there any chance of fixing it?\"\n",
      "\"No,\" said Harry. \"The tree smashed it to bits.\"\n",
      "Lupin sighed.\n",
      "\"They planted the Whomping Willow the same year that I arrived at\n",
      "Hogwarts. People used to play a game, trying to get near enough to touch\n",
      "the trunk. In the end, a boy called Davey Gudgeon nearly lost an eye,\n",
      "and we were forbidden to go near it. No broomstick would have a chance.\"\n",
      "154\n",
      "\"Did you hear about the dementors too?\" said Harry with difficulty.\n",
      "Lupin looked at him quickly.\n",
      "\"Yes, I did. I don't think any of us have seen Professor Dumbledore that\n",
      "angry. They have been growing restless for some time furious at his\n",
      "refusal to let them inside the grounds.... I suppose they were the\n",
      "reason you fell?\"\n",
      "\"Yes,\" said Harry. He hesitated, and then the question he had to ask\n",
      "burst from him before he could stop himself.\" Why? Why do they affect me\n",
      "like that? Am I just --?\"\n",
      "\"It has nothing to do with weakness,\" said Professor Lupin sharply, as\n",
      "though he had read Harry's mind. \"The dementors affect you worse than\n",
      "the others because there are horrors in your past that the others don't\n",
      "have.\"\n",
      "A ray of wintery sunlight fell across the classroom, illuminating\n",
      "Lupin's gray hairs and the lines on his young face.\n",
      "\"Dementors are among the foulest creatures that walk this earth. They\n",
      "infest the darkest, filthiest places, they glory in decay and despair,\n",
      "they drain peace, hope, and happiness out of the air around them. Even\n",
      "Muggles feel their presence, though they can't see them. Get too near a\n",
      "dementor and every good feeling, every happy memory will be sucked out\n",
      "of you. If it can, the dementor will feed on you long enough to reduce\n",
      "you to something like itself... soul-less and evil. You'll be left with\n",
      "nothing but the worst experiences of your life. And the worst that\n",
      "happened to you, Harry, is enough to make anyone fall off their broom.\n",
      "You have nothing to feel ashamed of.\"\n",
      "\"When they get near me Harry stared at Lupin's desk, his throat\n",
      "tight. \"I can hear Voldemort murdering my mum.\"\n",
      "Lupin made a sudden motion with his arm as though to grip Harry's\n",
      "shoulder, but thought better of it. There was a moment's Silence, then\n",
      "\"Why did they have to come to the match?\" said Harry bitterly.\n",
      "155\n",
      "\"They're getting hungry,\" said Lupin coolly, shutting his briefcase with\n",
      "a snap. \"Dumbledore won't let them into the school, so their supply of\n",
      "human prey has dried up.... I don't think they could resist the large\n",
      "crowd around the Quidditch field. All that excitement ... emotions\n",
      "running high... it was their idea of a feast.\"\n",
      "\"Azkaban must be terrible,\" Harry muttered. Lupin nodded grimly.\n",
      "\"The fortress is set on a tiny island, way out to sea, but they don't\n",
      "need walls and water to keep the prisoners in, not when they're all\n",
      "trapped inside their own heads, incapable of a single cheery thought.\n",
      "Most of them go mad within weeks.\"\n",
      "\"But Sirius Black escaped from them,\" Harry said slowly. \"He got\n",
      "away...\"\n",
      "Lupin's briefcase slipped from the desk; he had to stoop quickly to\n",
      "catch it.\n",
      "\"Yes,\" he said, straightening up, \"Black must have found a way to fight\n",
      "them. I wouldn't have believed it possible.... Dementors are supposed to\n",
      "drain a wizard of his powers if he is left with them too long....\"\n",
      "\"You made that dementor on the train back off,\" said Harry suddenly.\n",
      "\"There are certain defenses one can use,\" said Lupin. \"But there was\n",
      "only one dementor on the train. The more there are, the more difficult\n",
      "it becomes to resist.\"\n",
      "\"What defenses?\" said Harry at once. \"Can you teach me?\"\n",
      "\"I don't pretend to be an expert at fighting dementors, Harry, quite the\n",
      "contrary...\"\n",
      "\"But if the dementors come to another Quidditch match, I need to be able\n",
      "to fight them --\"\n",
      "Lupin looked into Harry's determined face, hesitated, then said,\n",
      "\"Well... all right. I'll try and help. But it'll have to wait until next\n",
      "156\n",
      "term, I'm afraid. I have a lot to do before the holidays. I chose a very\n",
      "inconvenient time to fall ill.\"\n",
      "What with the promise of anti-dementor lessons from Lupin, the thought\n",
      "that he might never have to hear his mother's death again, and the fact\n",
      "that Ravenclaw flattened Hufflepuff in their Quidditch match at the end\n",
      "of November, Harry's mood took a definite upturn. Gryffindor were not\n",
      "out of the running after all, although they could not afford to lose\n",
      "another match. Wood became repossessed of his manic energy, and worked\n",
      "his team as hard as ever in the chilly haze of rain that persisted into\n",
      "December. Harry saw no hint of a dementor within the grounds.\n",
      "Dumbledore's anger seemed to be keeping them at their stations at the\n",
      "entrances.\n",
      "Two weeks before the end of the term, the sky lightened suddenly to a\n",
      "dazzling, opaline white and the muddy grounds were revealed one morning\n",
      "covered in glittering frost. Inside the castle, there was a buzz of\n",
      "Christmas in the air. Professor Flitwick, the Charms teacher, had\n",
      "already decorated his classroom with shimmering lights that turned out\n",
      "to be real, fluttering fairies. The students were all happily discussing\n",
      "their plans for the holidays. Both Ron and Hermione had decided to\n",
      "remain at Hogwarts, and though Ron said it was because he couldn't stand\n",
      "two weeks with Percy, and Hermione insisted she needed to use the\n",
      "library, Harry wasn't fooled; they were doing it to keep him company,\n",
      "and he was very grateful.\n",
      "To everyone's delight except Harry's, there was to be another Hogsmeade\n",
      "trip on the very last weekend of the term.\n",
      "\"We can do all our Christmas shopping there!\" said Hermione. \"Mum and\n",
      "Dad would really love those Toothflossing Stringmints from Honeydukes!\"\n",
      "Resigned to the fact that he would be the only third year staying behind\n",
      "again, Harry borrowed a copy of Which Broomstick from Wood, and decided\n",
      "to spend the day reading up on the different makes. He had been riding\n",
      "one of the school brooms at team practice, an ancient Shooting Star,\n",
      "which was very slow and jerky; he definitely needed a new broom of his\n",
      "own.\n",
      "On the Saturday morning of the Hogsmeade trip, Harry bid good-bye to Ron\n",
      "157\n",
      "and Hermione, who were wrapped in cloaks and scarves, then turned up the\n",
      "marble staircase alone, and headed back toward Gryffindor Tower. Snow\n",
      "had started to fall outside the windows, and the castle was very still\n",
      "and quiet.\n",
      "\"Psst -- Harry!\"\n",
      "He turned, halfway along the third-floor corridor, to see Fred and\n",
      "George peering out at him from behind a statue of a humpbacked, one-eyed\n",
      "witch.\n",
      "\"What are you doing?\" said Harry curiously. \"How come you're not going\n",
      "to Hogsmeade?\"\n",
      "\"We've come to give you a bit of festive cheer before we go,\" said Fred,\n",
      "with a mysterious wink. \"Come in here....\"\n",
      "He nodded toward an empty classroom to the left of the one-eyed statue.\n",
      "Harry followed Fred and George inside. George closed the door quietly\n",
      "and then turned, beaming, to look at Harry.\n",
      "\"Early Christmas present for you, Harry,\" he said.\n",
      "Fred pulled something from inside his cloak with a flourish and laid it\n",
      "on one of the desks. It was a large, square, very worn piece of\n",
      "parchment with nothing written on it. Harry, suspecting one of Fred and\n",
      "George's jokes, stared at it.\n",
      "\"What's that supposed to be?\"\n",
      "\"This, Harry, is the secret of our success,\" said George, patting the\n",
      "parchment fondly.\n",
      "\"It's a wrench, giving it to you,\" said Fred, \"but we decided last\n",
      "night, your need's greater than ours.\"\n",
      "\"Anyway, we know it by heart,\" said George. \"We bequeath it to you. We\n",
      "don't really need it anymore.\"\n",
      "\"And what do I need with a bit of old parchment?\" said Harry.\n",
      "158\n",
      "\"A bit of old parchment!\" said Fred, closing his eyes with a grimace as\n",
      "though Harry had mortally offended him. \"Explain, George.\"\n",
      "\"Well... when we were in our first year, Harry -- young, carefree, and\n",
      "innocent --\"\n",
      "Harry snorted. He doubted whether Fred and George had ever been\n",
      "innocent.\n",

      "this.\"\n",
      "\"It's not as bad as it sounds, you know,\" said George. \"We don't reckon\n",

      "though, or he wouldn't have confiscated it.\"\n",

      "Mrs. Norris turn left and pause to sniff at something on the floor. If\n",

      "one-eyed witch.\n",
      "What did he have to do? He pulled out the map again and saw to his\n",
      "astonishment, that a new ink figure had appeared upon it, labeled Harry\n",
      "Potter. This figure was standing exactly where the real Harry was\n",
      "standing, about halfway down the third-floor corridor.\n",
      "Harry watched carefully. His little Ink self appeared to be tapping the\n",
      "witch with his minute wand. Harry quickly took out his real wand and\n",
      "tapped the statue. Nothing happened. He looked back at the map. The\n",
      "tiniest speech bubble had appeared next to his figure. The word inside\n",
      "said, \"Dissendium.\"\n",
      "\"Dissendium!\" Harry whispered, tapping the stone witch again.\n",

      "person. Harry glanced quickly up and down the corridor, then tucked the\n",
      "map away again, hoisted himself into the hole headfirst, and pushed\n",
      "himself forward.\n",
      "He slid a considerable way down what felt like a stone slide, then\n",
      "landed on cold, damp earth. He stood up, looking around. It was\n",
      "pitch dark. He held up his wand, muttered, \"Lumos! \" and saw that he was\n",
      "in a very narrow, low, earthy passageway. He raised the map, tapped it\n",
      "with the tip of his wand, and muttered, \"Mischief managed!\" The map went\n",
      "blank at once. He folded it carefully, tucked it inside his robes, then,\n",
      "heart beating fast, both excited and apprehensive, he set off.\n",
      "The passage twisted and turned, more like the burrow of a giant rabbit\n",
      "than anything else. Harry hurried along it, stumbling now and then on\n",
      "the uneven floor, holding his wand out in front of him.\n",
      "It took ages, but Harry had the thought of Honeydukes to sustain him.\n",
      "After what felt like an hour, the passage began to rise. Panting, Harry\n",
      "sped up, his face hot, his feet very cold.\n",
      "Ten minutes later, he came to the foot of some worn stone steps, which\n",
      "rose out of sight above him. Careful not to make any noise, Harry began\n",
      "to climb. A hundred steps, two hundred steps, he lost count as he\n",
      "162\n",
      "climbed, watching his feet.... Then, without warning, his head hit\n",
      "something hard.\n",
      "It seemed to be a trapdoor. Harry stood there, massaging the top of his\n",
      "head, listening. He couldn't hear any sounds above him. Very slowly, he\n",
      "pushed the trapdoor open and peered over the edge.\n",
      "He was in a cellar, which was full of wooden crates and boxes. Harry\n",
      "climbed out of the trapdoor and replaced it -- it blended so perfectly\n",
      "with the dusty floor that it was impossible to tell it was there. Harry\n",
      "crept slowly toward the wooden staircase that led upstairs. Now he could\n",
      "definitely hear voices, not to mention the tinkle of a bell and the\n",
      "opening and shutting of a door.\n",
      "Wondering what he ought to do, he suddenly heard a door open much closer\n",
      "at hand; somebody was about to come downstairs.\n",
      "\"And get another box of Jelly Slugs, dear, they've nearly cleaned us out\n",
      "--\" said a woman's voice.\n",
      "A pair of feet was coming down the staircase. Harry leapt behind an\n",

      "shifting boxes against the opposite wall. He might not get another\n",
      "chance --\n",
      "Quickly and silently, Harry dodged out from his hiding place and climbed\n",

      "head, buried in a box. Harry reached the door at the top of the stairs,\n",
      "slipped through it, and found himself behind the counter of Honeydukes\n",

      "advised them to go into hiding. Well, of course, You-Know-Who wasn't an\n",

      "playing in that match.\"\n",
      "\"Well, he wasn't in the hospital wing,\" said Ron. \"I was there, cleaning\n",

      "the depths of his bed and stowing him in his pajama pocket.\n",
      "But Hermione wasn't listening. She dropped Crookshanks onto Seamus's\n",
      "empty bed and stared, open-mouthed, at the Firebolt.\n",
      "\"Oh, Harry! Who sent you that?\"\n",
      "\"No idea,\" said Harry. \"There wasn't a card or anything with it.\"\n",

      "intrigued by the news. On the contrary, her face fell, and she bit her\n",
      "lip.\n",
      "\"What's the matter with you?\" said Ron.\n",
      "\"I don't know,\" said Hermione slowly, \"but it's a bit odd, isn't it? I\n",
      "mean, this is supposed to be quite a good broom, isn't it?\"\n",

      "\"Probably cost more than all the Slytherins' brooms put together,\" said\n",
      "Ron happily.\n",
      "\"Well... who'd send Harry something as expensive as that, and not even\n",
      "tell him they'd sent it?\" said Hermione.\n",
      "\"Who cares?\" said Ron impatiently. \"Listen, Harry, can I have a go on\n",
      "it? Can I?\"\n",
      "\"I don't think anyone should ride that broom just yet!\" said Hermione\n",
      "shrilly.\n",

      "ripped his pajamas and Scabbers attempted a wild escape over his\n",
      "shoulder. Ron seized Scabbers by the tail and aimed a misjudged kick at\n",
      "Crookshanks that hit the trunk at the end of Harry's bed, knocking it\n",
      "over and causing Ron to hop up and down, howling with pain.\n",
      "Crookshanks's fur suddenly stood on end. A shrill, tint,, whistling was\n",
      "filling the room. The Pocket Sneakoscope had become dislodged from Uncle\n",
      "Vernon's old socks and was whirling and gleaming on the floor.\n",
      "I forgot about that!\" Harry said, bending down and picking up the\n",
      "Sneakoscope. I never wear those socks if I can help it....\n",
      "The Sneakoscope whirled and whistled in his palm. Crookshanks was\n",

      "\"You'd better take that cat out of here, Hermione,\" said Ron furiously,\n",

      "he added to Harry as Hermione strode out of the room, Crookshanks's\n",
      "yellow eyes still fixed maliciously on Ron.\n",
      "Harry stuffed the Sneakoscope back inside the socks and threw it back\n",
      "into his trunk. All that could be heard now were Ron's stifled moans of\n",
      "pain and rage. Scabbers was huddled in Ron's hands. It had been a while\n",
      "since Harry had seen him out of Ron's pocket, and he was unpleasantly\n",
      "surprised to see that Scabbers, once so fat, was now very skinny;\n",
      "patches of fur seemed to have fallen out too\n",
      "\"He's not looking too good, is he?\" Harry said.\n",
      "\"It's stress!\" said Ron. \"He'd be fine if that big stupid furball left\n",
      "him alone!\"\n",
      "But Harry, remembering what the woman at the Magical Menagerie had said\n",
      "about rats living only three years, couldn't help feeling that unless\n",

      "heaved onto Professor Binn's desk.\n",
      "195\n",
      "\"What's that?\" said Harry.\n",
      "\"Another boggart,\" said Lupin, stripping off his cloak. \"I've been\n",
      "combing the castle ever since Tuesday, and very luckily, I found this\n",
      "one lurking inside Mr. Filch's filing cabinet. It's the nearest we'll\n",
      "get to a real dementor. The boggart will turn into a dementor when he\n",
      "sees you, so we'll be able to practice on him. I can store him in my\n",

      "like.\"\n",
      "\"Okay,\" said Harry, trying to sound as though he wasn't apprehensive at\n",

      "real dementor.\n",
      "\"So...\" Professor Lupin had taken out his own wand, and indicated that\n",
      "Harry should do the same. \"The spell I am going to try and teach you is\n",
      "highly advanced magic, Harry -- well beyond ordinary Wizarding Level. It\n",
      "is called the Patronus Charm.\"\n",
      "\"How does it work?\" said Harry nervously.\n",
      "\"Well, when it works correctly, It conjures up a Patronus,\" said Lupin,\n",
      "\"which is a kind of anti- dementor a guardian that acts as a shield\n",
      "between you and the dementor.\"\n",
      "--\n",
      "Harry had a sudden vision of himself crouching behind a Hagridsized\n",

      "a kind of positive force, a projection of the very things that the\n",
      "dementor feeds upon -- hope, happiness, the desire to survive -- but it\n",
      "cannot feel despair, as real humans can, so the dementors can't hurt it.\n",
      "But I must warn you, Harry, that the charm might be too advanced for\n",
      "you. Many qualified wizards have difficulty with it.\"\n",
      "\"What does a Patronus look like?\" said Harry curiously.\n",
      "\"Each one is unique to the wizard who conjures it.\"\n",
      "\"And how do you conjure it?\"\n",
      "196\n",
      "\"With an incantation, which will work only if you are concentrating,\n",
      "with all your might, on a single, very happy memory.\"\n",
      "Harry cast his mind about for a happy memory. Certainly, nothing that\n",

      "Stan, \"did you say it goes anywhere?\"\n",
      "\"Yep,\" said Stan proudly, \"anywhere you like, long's it's on land. Can't\n",

      "\"I'm not buying anything Malfoy thinks is good,\" said Harry flatly.\n",
      "January faded imperceptibly into February, with no change in the\n",
      "bitterly cold weather. The match against Ravenclaw was drawing nearer\n",
      "and nearer, but Harry still hadn't ordered a new broom. He was now\n",
      "asking Professor McGonagall for news of the Firebolt after every\n",

      "rushing past with her face averted.\n",
      "\"No, Potter, you can't have it back yet,\" Professor McGonagall told him\n",
      "the twelfth time this happened, before he'd even opened his mouth.\n",
      "\"We've checked for most of the usual curses, but Professor Flitwick\n",
      "believes the broom might be carrying a Hurling Hex. I shall tell you\n",

      "once we've finished checking it. Now, please stop badgering me.\"\n",
      "To make matters even worse, Harry's anti-dementor lessons were not going\n",
      "nearly as well as he had hoped. Several sessions on, he was able to\n",
      "produce an indistinct, silvery shadow every time the boggart-dementor\n",
      "approached him, but his Patronus was too feeble to drive the dementor\n",
      "away. All it did was hover, like a semitransparent cloud, draining Harry\n",
      "of energy as he fought to keep it there. Harry felt angry with himself,\n",
      "guilty about his secret desire to hear his parents' voices again.\n",
      "\"You're expecting too much of yourself,\" said Professor Lupin, sternly\n",
      "in their fourth week of practice. \"For a thirteen-year-old wizard, even\n",
      "an indistinct Patronus is a huge achievement. You aren't passing out\n",
      "anymore, are you?\"\n",
      "I thought a Patronus would -- charge the dementors down or something,\"\n",
      "said Harry dispiritedly. \"Make them disappear --\"\n",
      "\"The true Patronus does do that,\" said Lupin. \"But you've achieved a\n",
      "great deal in a very short space of time. If the dementors put in an\n",
      "appearance at your next Quidditch match, You will be able to keep them\n",
      "at bay long enough to get back to the ground.\"\n",
      "\"You said it's harder if there are loads of them,\" said Harry.\n",
      "\"I have complete confidence in you,\" said Lupin, smiling. \"Here --\n",
      "you've earned a drink - something from the Three Broomsticks. You won't\n",
      "have tried it before --\"\n",
      "He pulled two bottles out of his briefcase.\n",
      "\"Butterbeer!\" said Harry, without thinking. \"Yeah, I like that stuff!\"\n",
      "Lupin raised an eyebrow.\n",
      "\"Oh -Ron and Hermione brought me some back from Hogsmeade,\" Harry lied\n",
      "quickly.\n",
      "I see,\" said Lupin, though he still looked slightly suspicious. \"Well\n",
      "let's drink to a Gryffindor victory against Ravenclaw! Not that I'm\n",
      "204\n",
      "supposed to take sides, as a teacher... \" he added hastily\n",
      "They drank the butterbeer in silence, until Harry voiced something he'd\n",
      "been wondering for a while.\n",
      "\"What's under a dementor's hood?\"\n",
      "Professor Lupin lowered his bottle thoughtfully.\n",
      "\"Hmmm... well, the only people who really know are in no condition to\n",
      "tell us. You see, the dementor lowers its hood only to use its last and\n",
      "worst weapon.\"\n",
      "\"What's that?\"\n",
      "\"They call it the Dementor's Kiss,\" said Lupin, with a slightly twisted\n",
      "smile. \"It's what dementors do to those they wish to destroy utterly. I\n",
      "suppose there must be some kind of mouth under there, because they clamp\n",
      "their jaws upon the mouth of the victim and -- and suck out his soul.\"\n",
      "Harry accidentally spat out a bit of butterbeer.\n",
      "\"What -- they kill --?\"\n",
      "\"Oh no,\" said Lupin. \"Much worse than that. You can exist without your\n",
      "soul, you know, as long as your brain and heart are still working. But\n",
      "you'll have no sense of self anymore, no memory, no... anything.\n",
      "There's no chance at all of recovery. You'll just exist. As an empty\n",
      "shell. And your soul is gone forever... lost.\"\n",
      "Lupin drank a little more butterbeer, then said, \"It's the fate that\n",
      "awaits Sirius Black. It was in the Daily Prophet this morning. The\n",
      "Ministry have given the dementors permission to perform it if they find\n",
      "him.\"\n",
      "Harry sat stunned for a moment at the idea of someone having their soul\n",
      "sucked out through their mouth. But then he thought of Black.\n",
      "\"He deserves it,\" he said suddenly.\n",
      "205\n",
      "\"You think so?\" said Lupin lightly. \"Do you really think anyone deserves\n",
      "that?\"\n",
      "\"Yes,\" said Harry defiantly. \"For... for some things...\"\n",
      "He would have liked to have told Lupin about the conversation he'd\n",
      "overheard about Black in the Three Broomsticks, about Black betraying\n",
      "his mother and father, but it would have involved revealing that he'd\n",
      "gone to Hogsmeade without permission, and he knew Lupin wouldn't be very\n",
      "impressed by that. So he finished his butterbeer, thanked Lupin, and\n",
      "left the History of Magic classroom.\n",
      "Harry half wished that he hadn't asked what was under a dementor's hood,\n",
      "the answer had been so horrible, and he was so lost in unpleasant\n",
      "thoughts of what it would feel like to have your soul sucked out of you\n",
      "that he walked headlong into Professor McGonagall halfway up the stairs.\n",
      "\"Do watch where you're going, Potter!\"\n",
      "\"Sorry, Professor --\"\n",
      "\"I've just been looking for you in the Gryffindor common room, Well,\n",
      "here it is, we've done everything we could think of, and there doesn't\n",
      "seem to be anything wrong with it at all. You've got a very good friend\n",
      "somewhere, Potter....\"\n",
      "Harry's jaw dropped. She was holding out his Firebolt, and it looked as\n",
      "magnificent as ever.\n",
      "\"I can have it back?\" Harry said weakly. \"Seriously?\"\n",
      "\"Seriously,\" said Professor McGonagall, and she was actually smiling. \"I\n",
      "daresay you'll need to get the feel of it before Saturday's match, won't\n",
      "you? And Potter -- do try and win, won't you? Or we'll be out of the\n",

      "enough to remind me only last night....\"\n",
      "Speechless, Harry carried the Firebolt back upstairs toward Gryffindor\n",

      "from ear to ear.\n",
      "206\n",
      "\"She gave it to You? Excellent! Listen, can I still have a go on it?\n",
      "Tomorrow?\"\n",
      "\"Yeah... anything,\" said Harry, his heart lighter than it had been in a\n",

      "only trying to help....\"\n",
      "==\n",

      "even, my fine young yeomen! Come clap this loon in irons. He is trying\n",
      "to force entry to the chambers within!\"\n",
      "\"Oh, shut up,\" said Ron as he and Harry drew level with Neville.\n",
      "\"I've lost the passwords!\" Neville told them miserably. \"I made him tell\n",

      "changing them, and now I don't know what I've done with them!\"\n",
      "\"Oddsbodikins,\" said Harry to Sir Cadogan, who looked extremely\n",
      "disappointed and reluctantly swung forward to let them into the common\n",

      "clear view of Hermione, the only person who hadn't rushed over them,\n",
      "bent over her work and carefully avoiding their eyes. Harry and Ron\n",
      "approached her table and at last, she looked up.\n",

      "\"Yeah, I suppose so,\" said Harry. \"Id better put it upstairs.\"\n",

      "It was better than he'd ever dreamed. The Firebolt turned with the\n",
      "lightest touch; it seemed to obey his thoughts rather than his grip; it\n",
      "sped across the field at such speed that the stadium turned into a\n",

      "seconds had caught it tightly in his hand.\n",
      "The team cheered madly. Harry let the Snitch go again, gave it a\n",
      "minute's head start, then tore after it, weaving in and out of the\n",

      "Firebolt in their midst, performed their best moves faultlessly, and by\n",
      "the time they hit the ground again, Wood didn't have a single criticism\n",

      "to meet him. Madam Hooch had fallen asleep in her seat.\n",

      "a start, told Harry and Ron off for not waking her, and insisted that\n",
      "they go back to the castle.\n",
      "Harry shouldered the Firebolt and he and Ron walked out of the shadowy\n",
      "stadium, discussing the Firebolt's superbly smooth action, its\n",
      "phenomenal acceleration, and its pinpoint turning. They were halfway\n",
      "toward the castle when Harry, glancing to his left, saw something that\n",
      "made his heart turn over a pair of eyes, gleaming out of the\n",
      "darkness.\n",
      "Harry stopped dead, his heart banging against his ribs.\n",
      "\"What's the matter?\" said Ron.\n",
      "Harry pointed. Ron pulled out his wand and muttered, \"Lumos!\"\n",
      "A beam of light fell across the grass, hit the bottom of a tree, and\n",
      "illuminated its branches; there, crouching among the budding leaves, was\n",
      "Crookshanks.\n",
      "\"Get out of here!\" Ron roared, and he stooped down and seized a stone\n",
      "lying on the grass, but before he could do anything else, Crookshanks\n",
      "had vanished with one swish of his long ginger tail.\n",
      "\"See?\" Ron said furiously, chucking the stone down again. \"She's still\n",
      "letting him wander about wherever he wants -- probably washing down\n",
      "Scabbers with a couple of birds now....\"\n",
      "Harry didn't say anything. He took a deep breath as relief seeped\n",
      "through him; he had been sure for a moment that those eyes had belonged\n",
      "213\n",
      "to the Grim. They set off for the castle once more. slightly ashamed of\n",
      "his moment of panic, Harry didn't say anything to Ron nor did he look\n",
      "left or right until they had reached the well-lit entrance hall.\n",
      "Harry went down to breakfast the next morning with the rest of the boys\n",
      "in his dormitory, all of whom seemed to think the Firebolt deserved a\n",
      "sort of guard of honor. As Harry entered the Great Hall, heads turned in\n",
      "the direction of the Firebolt, and there was a good deal of excited\n",
      "muttering. Harry saw, with enormous satisfaction, that the Slytherin\n",
      "team were all looking thunderstruck.\n",
      "\"Did you see his face?\" said Ron gleefully, looking back at Malfay. \"He\n",
      "can't believe it! This is brilliant!\"\n",
      "Wood, too, was basking in the reflected glory of the Firebolt.\n",
      "\"Put it here, Harry,\" he said, laying the broom in the middle of the\n",
      "table and carefully turning it so that its name faced upward. People\n",
      "from the Ravenclaw and Hufflepuff tables were soon coming over to look.\n",
      "Cedric Diggory came over to congratulate Harry on having acquired such a\n",
      "superb replacement for his Nimbus, and Percy's Ravenclaw girlfriend,\n",
      "Penelope Clearwater, asked if she could actually hold the Firebolt.\n",
      "\"Now, now, Penny, no sabotage!\" said Percy heartily as she examined the\n",
      "Firebolt closely. \"Penelope and I have got a bet on,\" he told the team.\n",
      "\"Ten Galleons on the outcome of the match!\"\n",
      "Penelope put the Firebolt down again, thanked Harry, and went back to\n",
      "her table.\n",
      "\"Harry -- make sure you win,\" said Percy, in an urgent whisper. \"I\n",
      "haven't got ten Galleons. Yes, I'm coming, Penny!\" And-he bustled off to\n",
      "join her in a piece of toast.\n",
      "\"Sure you can manage that broom, Potter?\" said a cold, drawling voice.\n",
      "Draco Malfoy had arrived for a closer look, Crabbe and Coyle right\n",
      "behind him.\n",
      "\"Yeah, reckon so,\" said Harry casually.\n",
      "214\n",
      "\"Got plenty of special features, hasn't it?\" said Malfoy, eyes\n",
      "glittering maliciously. \"Shame it doesn't come with a parachute -- in\n",
      "case you get too near a dementor.\"\n",
      "Crabbe and Goyle sniggered.\n",
      "\"Pity you can't attach an extra arm to yours, Malfoy,\" said Harry. \"Then\n",
      "it could catch the Snitch for you.\"\n",
      "The Gryffindor team laughed loudly. Malfoy's pale eyes narrowed, and he\n",
      "stalked away. They watched him rejoin the rest of the Slytherin team,\n",
      "who put their heads together, no doubt asking Malfoy whether Harry's\n",
      "broom really was a Firebolt.\n",
      "At a quarter to eleven, the Gryffindor team set off for the locker\n",
      "rooms. The weather couldn't have been more different from their match\n",
      "against Hufflepuff. It was a clear, cool day with a very light breeze;\n",
      "there would be no visibility problems this time, and Harry, though\n",
      "nervous, was starting to feel the excitement only a Quidditch match\n",
      "could bring. They could hear the rest of the school moving into the\n",
      "stadium beyond. Harry took off his black school robes, removed his wand\n",
      "from his pocket, and stuck it inside the T-shirt he was going to wear\n",
      "under his Quidditch robes. He only hoped he wouldn't need it. He\n",
      "wondered suddenly whether Professor Lupin was in the crowd, watching.\n",
      "\"You know what we've got to do,\" said Wood as they prepared to leave the\n",
      "locker rooms. \"If we lose this match, we're out of the running. just --\n",
      "just fly like you did in practice yesterday, and we'll be okay!\"\n",
      "They walked out onto the field to tumultuous applause. The Ravenclaw\n",
      "team, dressed in blue, were already standing in the middle of the field.\n",
      "Their Seeker, Cho Chang, was the only girl on their team. She was\n",
      "shorter than Harry by about a head, and Harry couldn't help noticing,\n",
      "nervous as he was, that she was extremely pretty. She smiled at Harry as\n",
      "the teams faced each other behind their captains, and he felt a slight\n",
      "lurch in the region of his stomach that he didn't think had anything to\n",
      "do with nerves.\n",
      "\"Wood, Davies, shake hands,\" Madam Hooch said briskly, and Wood shook\n",
      "215\n",
      "hands with the Ravenclaw Captain.\n",
      "\"Mount your brooms... on my whistle... three -- two -- one --\"\n",
      "Harry kicked off into the air and the Firebolt zoomed higher and faster\n",
      "than any other broom; he soared around the stadium and began squinting\n",
      "around for the Snitch, listening all the while to the commentary, which\n",
      "was being provided by the Weasley twins' friend Lee Jordan.\n",
      "\"They're off, and the big excitement this match is the Firebolt that\n",
      "Harry Potter is flying for Gryffindor. According to Which Broomstick,\n",

      "\"Okay, okay, Gryffindor in possession, Katie Bell of Gryffindor, heading\n",
      "for goal...\"\n",
      "Harry streaked past Katie in the opposite direction, gazing around for a\n",
      "glint of gold and noticing that Cho Chang was tailing him closely. She\n",
      "was undoubtedly a very good flier she kept cutting across him,\n",
      "forcing him to change direction.\n",
      "\"Show her your acceleration, Harry!\" Fred yelled as he whooshed past in\n",
      "pursuit of a Bludger that was aiming for Alicia.\n",
      "Harry urged the Firebolt forward as they rounded the Ravenclaw goal\n",
      "posts and Cho fell behind. Just as Katie succeeded in scoring the first\n",
      "goal of the match, and the Gryffindor end of the field went wild, he saw\n",

      "ten feet away\n",

      "nowhere; Harry veered off course, avoiding it by an inch, and in those\n",
      "few, crucial seconds, the Snitch had vanished.\n",
      "There was a great \"Ooooooh\" of disappointment from the Gryffindor\n",
      "supporters, but much applause for their Beater from the Ravenclaw end.\n",
      "George Weasley vented his feelings by hitting the second Bludger\n",

      "in a shadowy corner, then started to climb, fast as he could, his sweaty\n",

      "hoisted himself out; the hump closed, and just as Harry jumped out from\n",

      "to the dungeons and then into Snape's office.\n",
      "Harry had been in here only once before, and he had been in very serious\n",
      "trouble then too. Snape had aquired a few more slimy horrible things in\n",
      "jars since last time, all standing on shelves behind his desk, glinting\n",
      "in the firelight and adding to the threatening atmosphere.\n",
      "\"Sit,\" said Snape.\n",
      "Harry sat. Snape, however, remained, standing.\n",

      "Still, Harry didn't speak.\n",
      "\"Mr. Malfoy states that he was standing talking to Weasley, when a large\n",

      "could have happened?\"\n",
      "Harry tried to look mildly surprised.\n",
      "\"I don't know, Professor.\"\n",
      "Snape's eyes were boring into Harry's. It was exactly like trying to\n",
      "stare down a hippogriff. Harry tried hard not to blink.\n",
      "\"Mr. Malfoy then saw an extraordinary apparition. Can you imagine what\n",
      "it might have been, Potter?\"\n",
      "\"No,\" said Harry, now trying to sound innocently curious.\n",
      "\"It was your head, Potter. Floating in midair.\"\n",
      "236\n",
      "There was a long silence.\n",
      "\"Maybe he'd better go to Madam Pomfrey,\" said Harry. \"If he's seeing\n",
      "things like --\"\n",
      "\"What would your head have been doing in Hogsmeade, Potter?\" said Snape\n",
      "softly. \"Your head is not allowed in Hogsmeade. No part of your body has\n",
      "permission to be in Hogsmeade.\"\n",

      "fear. \"It sounds like Malfoy's having hallucin --\"\n",
      "\"Malfoy is not having hallucinations,\" snarled Snape, and he bent down,\n",
      "a hand on each arm of Harry's chair, so that their faces were a foot\n",
      "apart. \"If your head was in Hogsmeade, so was the rest of you.\"\n",
      "\"I've been up in Gryffindor Tower,\" said Harry. \"Like you told --\" \"Can\n",
      "anyone confirm that?\"\n",
      "Harry didn't say anything. Snape's thin mouth curled into a horrible\n",
      "smile.\n",
      "\"So,\" he said, straightening up again. \"Everyone from the Minister of\n",
      "Magic downward has been trying to keep famous Harry Potter safe from\n",
      "Sirius Black. But famous Harry Potter is a law unto himself Let the\n",
      "ordinary people worry about his safety! Famous Harry Potter goes where\n",
      "he wants to, with no thought for the consequences.\n",
      "Harry stayed silent. Snape was trying to provoke him into telling the\n",
      "truth. He wasn't going to do it. Snape had no proof -- yet.\n",
      "\"How extraordinarily like your father you are, Potter,\" Snape said\n",
      "suddenly, his eyes glinting. \"He too was exceedingly arrogant. A small\n",
      "amount of talent on the Quidditch field made him think he was a cut\n",
      "above the rest of us too. Strutting around the place with his friends\n",
      "and admirers... The resemblance between you is uncanny.\"\n",

      "neither do I.\"\n",
      "237\n",
      "\"Your father didn't set much store by rules either,\" Snape went on,\n",
      "pressing his advantage, his thin face full of malice. \"Rules were for\n",
      "lesser mortals, not Quidditch Cup-winners. His head was so swollen --\"\n",
      "\"SHUT UP!\"\n",
      "Harry was suddenly on his feet. Rage such as he had not felt since his\n",
      "last night in Privet Drive was coursing through him. He didn't care that\n",
      "Snape's face had gone rigid, the black eyes flashing dangerously.\n",
      "\"What did you say to me, Potter?\"\n",
      "\"I told you to shut up about my dad!\" Harry yelled. I know the truth,\n",
      "all right? He saved your life! Dumbledore told me! You wouldn't even be\n",
      "here if it wasn't for my dad!\"\n",
      "Snape's sallow skin had gone the color of sour milk.\n",
      "\"And did the headmaster tell you the circumstances in which your father\n",
      "saved my life?\" he whispered. \"Or did he consider the details too\n",
      "unpleasant for precious Potter's delicate ears?\"\n",
      "Harry bit his lip. He didn't know what had happened and didn't want to\n",
      "admit it -- but Snape seemed to have guessed the truth.\n",
      "I would hate for you to run away with a false idea of your father,\n",
      "Potter,\" he said, a terrible grin twisting his face. \"Have you been\n",
      "imagining some act of glorious heroism? Then let me correct you -- your\n",
      "saintly father and his friends played a highly amusing joke on me that\n",
      "would have resulted in my death if your father hadn't got cold feet at\n",
      "the last moment. There was nothing brave about what he did. He was\n",
      "saving his own skin as much as mine. Had their joke succeeded, he would\n",
      "have been expelled from Hogwarts.\"\n",
      "Snape's uneven, yellowish teeth were bared.\n",

      "\"Turn out your pockets, or we go straight to the headmaster! Pull them\n",
      "out, Potter!\"\n",

      "Snap picked up the Zonko's bag.\n",

      "\"Pity... pity...\"\n",

      "him hard in the ribs and jerked her head toward the entrance hall.\n",

      "seen anything in a crystal ball?\" he asked them unhappily.\n",
      "\"Nope,\" said Ron in an offhand voice. He kept checking his watch; Harry.\n",
      "knew that he was counting down the time until Buckbeak's appeal started.\n",
      "The line of people outside the classroom shortened very slowly. As each\n",
      "person climbed back down the silver ladder, the rest of the class\n",

      "But they all refused to say.\n",

      "\"That's convenient,\" snorted Ron. \"You know, I'm starting to think\n",

      "overhead -- \"she's a right old fraud.\"\n",
      "\"Yeah,\" said Harry, looking at his own watch. It-was now two o'clock.\n",

      "Ron grimaced at Harry and climbed the silver ladder out of sight. Harry\n",
      "was now the only person left to be tested. He settled himself on the\n",
      "floor with his back against the wall, listening to a fly buzzing in the\n",
      "sunny window, his mind across the grounds with Hagrid.\n",
      "Finally, after about twenty minutes, Ron's large feet reappeared on the\n",
      "ladder.\n",
      "\"How'd it go?\" Harry asked him, standing up.\n",
      "\"Rubbish,\" said Ron. \"Couldn't see a thing, so I made some stuff up.\n",

      "Trelawney sat waiting for him before a large crystal ball.\n",
      "\"Good day, my dear,\" she said softly. \"If you would kindly gaze into the\n",
      "Orb.... Take your time, now... then tell me what you see within it....\"\n",
      "Harry bent over the crystal ball and stared, stared as hard as he could,\n",
      "willing it to show him something other than swirling white fog, but\n",
      "nothing happened.\n",
      "\"Well?\" Professor Trelawney prompted delicately. \"What do you see?\"\n",
      "The heat was overpowering and his nostrils were stinging with the\n",
      "perfumed smoke wafting from the fire beside them. He thought of what Ron\n",
      "had just said, and decided to pretend.\n",
      "\"Er --\" said Harry, \"a dark shape... um...\"\n",
      "268\n",
      "\"What does it resemble?\" whispered Professor Trelawney. \"Think, now...\"\n",
      "Harry cast his mind around and it landed on Buckbeak.\n",
      "\"A hippogriff,\" he said firmly.\n",
      "\"Indeed!\" whispered Professor Trelawney, scribbling keenly on the\n",
      "parchment perched upon her knees. \"My boy, you may well be seeing the\n",
      "outcome of poor Hagrid's trouble with the Ministry of Magic! Look\n",
      "closer... Does the hippogriff appear to... have its head?\"\n",
      "\"Yes,\" said Harry firmly.\n",
      "\"Are you sure?\" Professor Trelawney urged him. \"Are you quite sure,\n",
      "dear? You don't see it writhing on the ground, perhaps, and a shadowy\n",
      "figure raising an axe behind it?\"\n",
      "\"No!\" said Harry, starting to feel slightly sick.\n",
      "\"No blood? No weeping Hagrid?\"\n",
      "\"No!\" said Harry again, wanting more than ever to leave the room and the\n",
      "heat. \"It looks fine, it's - - flying away...\"\n",
      "Professor Trelawney sighed.\n",
      "\"Well, dear, I think we'll leave it there.... A little disappointing...\n",
      "but I'm sure you did your best.\"\n",
      "Relieved, Harry got up, picked up his bag and turned to go, but then a\n",
      "loud, harsh voice spoke behind him.\n",
      "\"IT WILL HAPPEN TONIGHT.\"\n",

      "unreal, and even more so when he saw Buckbeak a few yards away, tethered\n",
      "to a tree behind Hagrid's Pumpkin patch. Buckbeak seemed to know\n",
      "something was happening. He turned his sharp head from side to side and\n",

      "movement from behind it; a low moan, and then a deep, loud purring. They\n",
      "exchanged a last look, a last nod.\n",
      "Wand held tightly before him, Harry kicked the door wide open.\n",
      "On a magnificent four-poster bed with dusty hangings lay Crookshanks,\n",

      "it's\n",
      "\"He's the dog... he's an Animagus.\"\n",
      "Ron was staring over Harry's shoulder. Harry wheeled around. With a\n",
      "snap, the man in the shadows closed the door behind them.\n",
      "A mass of filthy, matted hair hung to his elbows. If eyes hadn't been\n",
      "shining out of the deep, dark sockets, he might have been a corpse. The\n",
      "waxy skin was stretched so tightly over the bones of his face, it looked\n",
      "like a skull. His yellow teeth were bared in a grin. It was Sirius\n",
      "Black.\n",

      "Harry's and Hermione's wands shot out of their hands, high in the air,\n",
      "and Black caught them. Then he took a step closer. His eyes were fixed\n",
      "on Harry.\n",
      "\"I thought you'd come and help your friend,\" he said hoarsely.\n",

      "easier....\"\n",
      "The taunt about his father rang in Harry's ears as though Black had\n",

      "for fear. For the first time in his life, he wanted his wand back in his\n",
      "hand, not to defend himself, but to attack... to kill. Without knowing\n",
      "283\n",
      "what he was doing, he started forward, but there was a sudden movement\n",
      "on either side of him and two pairs of hands grabbed him and held him\n",
      "back.... \"No, Harry!\" Hermione gasped in a petrified whisper; Ron,\n",
      "however, spoke to Black.\n",
      "\"If you want to kill Harry, you'll have to kill us too!\" he said\n",
      "fiercely, though the effort of standing upright was draining him of\n",
      "still more color, and he swayed slightly as he spoke.\n",
      "Something flickered in Black's shadowed eyes.\n",
      "\"Lie down,\" he said quietly to Ron. \"You will damage that leg even\n",
      "more.\"\n",
      "\"Did you hear me?\" Ron said weakly, though he was clinging painfully to\n",
      "Harry to stay upright. \"You'll have to kill all three of us!\"\n",
      "\"There'll be only one murder here tonight,\" said Brack, and his grin\n",
      "widened.\n",
      "\"Why's that?\" Harry spat, trying to wrench himself free of Ron, and\n",
      "Hermione. \"Didn't care last time, did you? Didn't mind slaughtering all\n",
      "those Muggles to get at Pettigrew... What's the matter, gone soft in\n",
      "Azkaban?\"\n",
      "\"Harry!\" Hermione whimpered. \"Be quiet!\"\n",
      "\"HE KILLED MY MUM AND DAD!\" Harry roared, and with a huge effort he\n",
      "broke free of Hermione's and Ron's restraint and lunged forward -\n",
      "--\n",
      "He had forgotten about magic -- he had forgotten that he was short and\n",
      "skinny and thirteen, whereas Black was a tall, full-grown man - all\n",
      "Harry knew was that he wanted to hurt Black as badly as he could and\n",
      "that he didn't care how much he got hurt in return -\n",
      "Perhaps it was the shock of Harry doing something so stupid, but Black\n",
      "didn't raise the wands in time one of Harry's hands fastened over his\n",
      "wasted wrist, forcing the wand tips away; the knuckles of Harry's other\n",
      "hand collided with the side of Black's head and they fell, backward,\n",
      "into the wall -\n",
      "284\n",
      "Hermione was screaming; Ron was yelling; there was a blinding flash as\n",
      "the wands in Black's hand sent a jet of sparks into the air that missed\n",
      "Harry's face by inches; Harry felt the shrunken arm under his fingers\n",
      "twisting madly, but he clung on, his other hand punching every part of\n",
      "Black it could find.\n",
      "But Black's free hand had found Harry's throat\n",
      "\"No,\" he hissed, \"I've waited too long --\"\n",
      "The fingers tightened, Harry choked, his glasses askew.\n",
      "Then he saw Hermione's foot swing out of nowhere. Black let go of Harry\n",
      "with a grunt of pain; Ron had thrown himself on Black's wand hand and\n",
      "Harry heard a faint clatter --\n",
      "He fought free of the tangle of bodies and saw his own wand rolling\n",
      "across the floor; he threw himself toward it but\n",
      "\"Argh!\"\n",
      "Crookshanks had joined the fray; both sets of front claws had sunk\n",
      "themselves deep into Harry's arm; Harry threw him off, but Crookshanks\n",
      "now darted toward Harry's wand -\n",
      "\"NO YOU DON'T!\" roared Harry, and he aimed a kick at Crookshanks that\n",
      "made the cat leap aside, spitting; Harry snatched up his wand and turned\n",
      "\"Get out of the way!\" he shouted at Ron and Hermione.\n",
      "They didn't need telling twice. Hermione, gasping for breath, her lip\n",
      "bleeding, scrambled aside, snatching up her and Ron's wands. Ron crawled\n",
      "to the four-poster and collapsed onto it, panting, his white face now\n",
      "tinged with green, both hands clutching his broken leg.\n",
      "Black was sprawled at the bottom of the wall. His thin chest rose and\n",
      "fell rapidly as he watched Harry walking slowly nearer, his wand\n",
      "pointing straight at Black's heart.\n",
      "285\n",
      "\"Going to kill me, Harry?\" he whispered.\n",
      "Harry stopped right above him, his wand still pointing at Black's chest,\n",
      "looking down at him. A livid bruise was rising around Black's left eye\n",
      "and his nose was bleeding.\n",
      "\"You killed my parents,\" said Harry, his voice shaking slightly, but his\n",
      "wand hand quite steady.\n",
      "Black stared up at him out of those sunken eyes.\n",
      "\"I don't deny it,\" he said very quietly. \"But if you knew the whole\n",
      "story.\"\n",
      "\"The whole story?\" Harry repeated, a furious pounding in his ears. \"You\n",
      "sold them to Voldemort. That's all I need to know.\"\n",
      "\"You've got to listen to me,\" Black said, and there was a note of\n",
      "urgency in his voice now. \"You'll regret it if you don't.... You don't\n",
      "understand.…...\"\n",
      "\"I understand a lot better than you think,\" said Harry, and his voice\n",
      "shook more than ever. \"You never heard her, did you? My mum... trying to\n",
      "stop Voldemort killing me... and you did that... you did it....\"\n",
      "Before either of them could say another word, something ginger streaked\n",
      "past Harry; Crookshanks leapt onto Black's chest and settled himself\n",
      "there, right over Black's heart. Black blinked and looked down at the\n",
      "cat.\n",
      "\"Get off,\" he murmured, trying to push Crookshanks off him.\n",
      "But Crookshanks sank his claws into Black's robes and wouldn't shift. He\n",
      "turned his ugly, squashed face to Harry and looked up at him with those\n",
      "great yellow eyes. To his right, Hermione gave a dry sob.\n",
      "Harry stared down at Black and Crookshanks, his grip tightening on the\n",
      "wand. So what if he had to kill the cat too? It was in league with\n",
      "Black.... If it was prepared to die, trying to protect Black, that\n",
      "286\n",
      "wasn't Harry's business.... If Black wanted to save it, that only proved\n",
      "he cared more for Crookshanks than for Harry's parents....\n",
      "Harry raised the wand. Now was the moment to do it. Now was the moment\n",
      "to avenge his mother and father. He was going to kill Black. He had to\n",
      "kill Black. This was his chance....\n",
      "The seconds lengthened. And still Harry stood frozen there, wand poised,\n",
      "Black staring up at him, Crookshanks on his chest. Ron's ragged\n",
      "breathing came from near the bed; Hermione was quite silent.\n",
      "And then came a new sound -\n",
      "Muffled footsteps were echoing up through the floor -- someone was\n",
      "moving downstairs.\n",
      "\"WE'RE UP HERE!\" Hermione screamed suddenly. \"WE'RE UP HERE --\n",
      "SIRIUS\n",
      "BLACK - QUICK!\"\n",
      "Black made a startled movement that almost dislodged Crookshanks; Harry\n",
      "gripped his wand convulsively -- Do it now! said a voice in his head --\n",
      "but the footsteps were thundering up the stairs and Harry still hadn't\n",
      "done it.\n",
      "The door of the room burst open in a shower of red sparks and Harry\n",
      "wheeled around as Professor Lupin came hurtling into the room, his face\n",
      "bloodless, his wand raised and ready. His eyes flickered over Ron, lying\n",
      "on the floor, over Hermione, cowering next to the door, to Harry,\n",
      "standing there with his wand covering Black, and then to Black himself,\n",
      "crumpled and bleeding at Harry's feet.\n",
      "\"Expelliarmus!\" Lupin shouted.\n",
      "Harry's wand flew once more out of his hand; so did the two Hermione was\n",
      "holding. Lupin caught them all deftly, then moved into the room, staring\n",
      "at Black, who still had Crookshanks lying Protectively across his chest.\n",
      "Harry stood there, feeling suddenly empty. He hadn't done it. His nerve\n",
      "had failed him. Black was going to be handed back to the dementors.\n",
      "287\n",
      "Then Lupin spoke, in a very tense voice.\n",
      "\"Where is he, Sirius?\"\n",
      "Harry looked quickly at Lupin. He didn't understannd what Lupin meant.\n",
      "Who was Lupin talking about? He turned to look at Black again.\n",
      "Black's face was quite expressionless. For a few seconds, he didn't move\n",
      "at all. Then, very slowly, he raised his empty hand and pointed straight\n",
      "at Ron. Mystified, Harry glanced around at Ron, who looked bewildered.\n",
      "\"But then...\" Lupin muttered, staring at Black so intently it seemed he\n",
      "was trying to read his mind, \"... why hasn't he shown himself before\n",

      "He tried to heave himself up on his good leg, but Lupin raised his wand\n",
      "again, pointing it at Scabbers.\n",
      "\"You're going to hear me out, Ron,\" he said quietly. \"Just keep a tight\n",
      "hold on Peter while you listen.\"\n",
      "293\n",
      "\"HE'S NOT PETER, HE'S SCABBERS!\" Ron yelled, trying to fore the rat back\n",
      "into his front pocket, but Scabbers was fighting to hard; Ron swayed and\n",
      "overbalanced, and Harry caught him am pushed him back down to the bed.\n",
      "Then, ignoring Black, Harry turned to Lupin.\n",
      "There were witnesses who saw Pettigrew die,\" he said. \"A whole street\n",
      "full of them...\"\n",
      "\"They didn't see what they thought they saw!\" said Black savagely, still\n",
      "watching Scabbers struggling in Ron's hands.\n",
      "\"Everyone thought Sirius killed Peter,\" said Lupin, nodding. \"I believed\n",
      "it myself -- until I saw the map tonight. Because the Marauder's map\n",
      "never lies... Peter's alive. Ron's holding him, Harry.\"\n",
      "Harry looked down at Ron, and as their eyes met, they agreed, silently:\n",
      "Black and Lupin were both out of their minds. Their story made no sense\n",
      "whatsoever. How could Scabbers be Peter Pettigrew? Azkaban must have\n",
      "unhinged Black after all -- but why was Lupin playing along with him?\n",
      "Then Hermione spoke, in a trembling, would-be calm sort of voice, as\n",
      "though trying to will Professor Lupin to talk sensibly.\n",
      "\"But Professor Lupin... Scabbers can't be Pettigrew... it just can't be\n",
      "true, you know it can't...\"\n",
      "\"Why can't it be true?\" Lupin said calmly, as though they were in class,\n",
      "and Hermione had simply spotted a problem in an experiment with\n",
      "grindylows.\n",
      "\"Because... because people would know if Peter Pettigrew had been an\n",
      "Animagus. We did Animagi in class with Professor McGonagall. And I\n",
      "looked them up when I did my homework -- the Ministry of Magic keeps\n",
      "tabs on witches and wizards who can become animals; there's a register\n",
      "showing what animal they become, and their markings and things... and I\n",
      "went and looked Professor McGonagall up on the register, and there have\n",
      "been only seven Animagi this century, and Pettigrew's name wasn't on the\n",
      "list.\"\n",
      "294\n",
      "Harry had barely had time to marvel inwardly at the effort Hermione put\n",
      "into her homework, when Lupin started to laugh.\n",
      "\"Light again, Hermione!\" he said. \"But the Ministry never knew that here\n",
      "used to be three unregistered Animagi running around Hogwarts.\"\n",
      "\"I you're going to tell them the story, get a move on, Remus,\" said\n",

      "waited twelve years, I'm not going to wait much longer.\"\n",
      "\"All right... but you'll need to help me, Sirius,\" said Lupin, I only\n",
      "know how it began...\"\n",
      "Lupin broke off. There had been a loud creak behind him. The bedroom\n",
      "door had opened of its own accord. All five of them stared at it. Then\n",
      "Lupin strode toward it and looked out into the landing.\n",
      "\"No one there...\"\n",
      "\"This place is haunted!\" said Ron.\n",
      "\"It's not,\" said Lupin, still looking at the door in a puzzled way. \"The\n",
      "Shrieking Shack was never haunted.... The screams and howls the\n",
      "villagers used to hear were made by me.\"\n",
      "He pushed his graying hair out of his eyes, thought for a moment then\n",
      "said, \"That's where all of this starts with my becoming a werewolf,\n",
      "None of this could have happened if I hadn't been bitter... and if I\n",
      "hadn't been so foolhardy...\"\n",
      "--\n",
      "He looked sober and tired. Ron started to interrupt, but Hermione, said,\n",
      "\"Shh!\" She was watching Lupin very intently.\n",
      "\"I as a very small boy when I received the bite. My parents tried\n",
      "everything, but in those days there was no cure. The potion that\n",
      "Professor Snape has been making for me is a very recent discovery. It\n",
      "makes me safe, you see. As long as I take it in the week, preceding the\n",
      "full moon, I keep my mind when I transform.... I'm able to curl up in my\n",
      "office, a harmless wolf, and wait for the moon to wane again.\n",
      "295\n",
      "\"Before the Wolfsbane Potion was discovered, however, I became a fully\n",
      "fledged monster once a month. It seemed impossible that I would be able\n",
      "to come to Hogwarts. Other parents weren't likely to want their children\n",
      "exposed to me.\n",
      "\"But then Dumbledore became Headmaster, and he was sympathetic. He said\n",
      "that as long as we took certain precautions, there was no reason I\n",
      "shouldn't come to school....\" Lupin sighed, and looked directly at\n",
      "Harry. \"I told you, months ago, that the Whomping Willow was planted the\n",
      "year I came to Hogwarts. The truth is that it was planted because I came\n",
      "to Hogwarts. This house\" -- Lupin looked miserably around the room,\n",
      "\"the tunnel that leads to it -- they were built for my use. Once a\n",
      "month, I was smuggled out of the castle, into this place, to transform.\n",
      "The tree was placed at the tunnel mouth to stop anyone coming across me\n",
      "while I was dangerous.\"\n",
      "Harry couldn't see where this story was going, but he was listening\n",
      "raptly all the same. The only sound apart from Lupin's voice was\n",
      "Scabbers's frightened squeaking.\n",
      "\"My transformations in those days were were terrible. It is very\n",
      "painful to turn into a werewolf. I was separated from humans to bite, so\n",
      "I bit and scratched myself instead. The villagers heard the noise and\n",
      "the screaming and thought they were hearing particularly violent\n",
      "spirits. Dumbledore encouraged the rumor.... Even now, when the house\n",
      "has been silent for years, the villagers don't dare approach it....\"\n",
      "\"But apart from my transformations, I was happier than I had ever been\n",
      "in my life. For the first time ever, I had friends, three great friends.\n",
      "Sirius Black... Peter Pettigrew... and, of course, your father, Harry --\n",
      "James Potter.\"\n",
      "\"Now, my three friends could hardly fail to notice that I disappeared\n",
      "once a month. I made up all sorts of stories. I told them my mother was\n",
      "ill, and that I had to go home to see her... I was terrified they would\n",
      "desert me the moment they found out what I was. But of course, they,\n",
      "like you, Hermione, worked out the truth....\"\n",
      "\"And they didn't desert me at all. Instead, they did something for me\n",
      "that would make my transformations not only bearable, but the best times\n",
      "296\n",
      "of my life. They became Animagi.\"\n",
      "\"My dad too?\" said Harry, astounded.\n",
      "\"Yes, indeed,\" said Lupin. \"It took them the best part of three years to\n",
      "work out how to do it. Your father and Sirius here were the cleverest\n",
      "students in the school, and lucky they were, because the Animagus\n",
      "transformation can go horribly wrong -- one reason the Ministry keeps a\n",
      "close watch on those attempting to do it. Peter needed all the help he\n",
      "could get from James and Sirius. Finally, in our fifth year, they\n",
      "managed it. They could each turn into a different animal at will.\"\n",
      "\"But how did that help you?\" said Hermione, sounding puzzled.\n",
      "\"They couldn't keep me company as humans, so they kept me company as\n",
      "animals,\" said Lupin. \"A werewolf is only a danger to people. They\n",
      "sneaked out of the castle every month under James's Invisibility Cloak.\n",
      "They transformed... Peter, as the smallest, could slip beneath the\n",
      "Willow's attacking branches and touch the knot that freezes it. They\n",
      "would then slip down the tunnel and join me. Under their influence, I\n",
      "became less dangerous. My body was still wolfish, but my mind seemed to\n",
      "become less so while I was with them.\"\n",
      "\"Hurry up, Remus,\" snarled Black, who was still watching Scabbers with a\n",
      "horrible sort of hunger on his face.\n",
      "\"I'm getting there, Sirius, I'm getting there... well, highly exciting\n",
      "possibilities were open to us now that we could all transform. Soon we\n",
      "were leaving the Shrieking Shack and roaming the school grounds and the\n",
      "village by night. Sirius and James transformed into such large animals,\n",
      "they were able to keep a werewolf in check. I doubt whether any Hogwarts\n",
      "students ever found out more about the Hogwarts grounds and Hogsmeade\n",
      "than we did.... And that's how we came to write the Marauder's Map, and\n",
      "sign it with our nicknames. Sirius is Padfoot. Peter is Wormtail. James\n",
      "was Prongs.\"\n",
      "\"What sort of animal --?\" Harry began, but Hermione cut him off.\n",
      "\"That was still really dangerous! Running around in the dark with a\n",
      "werewolf! What if you'd given the others the slip, and bitten somebody?\"\n",
      "297\n",
      "\"A thought that still haunts me,\" said Lupin heavily. \"And there were\n",
      "near misses, many of them. We laughed about them afterwards. We were\n",
      "young, thoughtless -- carried away with our own cleverness.\"\n",
      "I sometimes felt guilty about betraying Dumbledore's trust, of course...\n",
      "he had admitted me to Hogwarts when no other headmaster would have done\n",
      "so, and he had no idea I was breaking the rules he had set down for my\n",
      "own and others' safety. He never knew I had led three fellow students\n",
      "into becoming Animagi illegally. But I always managed to forget my\n",
      "guilty feelings every time we sat down to plan our next month's\n",
      "adventure. And I haven't changed...\"\n",
      "Lupin's face had hardened, and there was self-disgust in his voice. \"All\n",
      "this year, I have been battling with myself, wondering whether I should\n",
      "tell Dumbledore that Sirius was an Animagus. But I didn't do it. Why?\n",
      "Because I was too cowardly. It would have meant admitting that I'd\n",
      "betrayed his trust while I was at school, admitting that I'd led others\n",
      "along with me... and Dumbledore's trust has meant everything to me. He\n",
      "let me into Hogwarts as a boy, and he gave me a job when I have been\n",
      "shunned all my adult life, unable to find paid work because of what I\n",
      "am. And so I convinced myself that Sirius was getting into the school\n",
      "using dark arts he learned from Voldemort, that being an Animagus had\n",
      "nothing to do with it... so, in a way, Snape's been right about me all\n",
      "along.\"\n",
      "\"Snape?\" said Black harshly, taking his eyes off Scabbers; for the first\n",
      "time in minutes and looking up at Lupin. \"What's Snape got to do with\n",
      "it?\"\n",
      "\"He's here, Sirius,\" said Lupin heavily. \"He's teaching here as well.\"\n",
      "He looked up at Harry, Ron, and Hermione.\n",
      "\"Professor Snape was at school with us. He fought very hard against my\n",
      "appointment to the Defense Against the Dark Arts job. He has been\n",
      "telling Dumbledore A year that I am not to be trusted. He has his\n",
      "reasons... you see, Sirius here played a trick on him which nearly\n",
      "killed him, a trick which involved me --\"\n",
      "Black made a derisive noise.\n",
      "298\n",
      "\"It served him right,\" he sneered. \"Sneaking around, trying to find out\n",

      "Harry, Ron, and Hermione. \"We were in the same year, you know, and we --\n",

      "Jealous, I think, of James's talent on the Quidditch field... anyway\n",
      "Snape had seen me crossing the grounds with Madam Pomfrey one evening as\n",
      "she led me toward the Whomping Willow to transform. Sirius thought it\n",
      "would be -- er -- amusing, to tell Snape all he had to do was prod the\n",

      "Fudge increased the pressure on Harry's shoulder, and Harry found\n",

      "wizened, toothless landlord.\n",
      "\"You've got him, Minister!\" said Tom. \"Will you be wanting anything?\n",
      "Beer? Brandy?\"\n",
      "\"Perhaps a pot of tea,\" said Fudge, who still hadn't let go of Harry.\n",
      "There was a loud scraping and puffing from behind them, and Stan and Ern\n",
      "appeared, carrying Harry's trunk and Hedwig's cage and looking around\n",
      "excitedly.\n",
      "\"Ow come you di'n't tell us 'oo you are, eh, Neville?\" said Stan,\n",
      "beaming at Harry, while Ernie's owlish face peered interestedly over\n",

      "\"And a private parlor, please, Tom,\" said Fudge pointedly.\n",
      "`Bye,\" Harry said miserably to Stan and Ern as Tom beckoned Fudge toward\n",

      "\"Bye, Neville!\" called Stan.\n",
      "Fudge marched Harry along the narrow passage after Tom's lantern, and\n",
      "then into a small parlor. Tom clicked his fingers, a fire burst into\n",
      "life in the grate, and he bowed himself out of the room.\n",
      "\"Sit down, Harry,\" said Fudge, indicating a chair by the fire.\n",
      "35\n",
      "Harry sat down, feeling goose bumps rising up his arms despite the glow\n",
      "of the fire. Fudge took off his pinstriped cloak and tossed it aside,\n",
      "then hitched up the trousers of his bottle-green suit and sat down\n",
      "opposite Harry.\n",
      "\"I am Cornelius Fudge, Harry. The Minister of Magic.\"\n",
      "Harry already knew this, of course; he had seen Fudge once before, but\n",
      "as he had been wearing his father's Invisibility Cloak at the time,\n",
      "Fudge wasn't to know that.\n",
      "Tom the innkeeper reappeared, wearing an apron over his nightshirt and\n",
      "bearing a tray of tea and crumpets. He placed the tray on a table\n",
      "between Fudge and Harry and left the parlor, closing the door behind\n",
      "him.\n",
      "\"Well, Harry,\" said Fudge, pouring out tea, \"you've had us all in a\n",
      "right flap, I don't mind telling you. Running away from your aunt and\n",
      "uncle's house like that! I'd started to think... but you're safe, and\n",
      "that's what matters.\"\n",
      "Fudge buttered himself a crumpet and pushed the plate toward Harry.\n",

      "to hear that we have dealt with the unfortunate blowing-up of Miss\n",
      "Marjorie Dursley. Two members of the Accidental Magic Reversal\n",
      "Department were dispatched to Privet Drive a few hours ago. Miss Dursley\n",
      "has been punctured and her memory has been modified. She has no\n",
      "recollection of the incident at all. So that's that, and no harm done.\"\n",
      "Fudge smiled at Harry over the rim of his teacup, rather like an uncle\n",
      "surveying a favorite nephew. Harry, who couldn't believe his ears,\n",
      "opened his mouth to speak, couldn't think of anything to say, and closed\n",
      "it again.\n",
      "\"Ah, you're worrying about the reaction of your aunt and uncle?\" said\n",
      "Fudge. \"Well, I won't deny that they are extremely angry, Harry, but\n",
      "they are prepared to take you back next summer as long as you stay at\n",
      "Hogwarts for the Christmas and Easter holidays.\"\n",
      "36\n",
      "Harry unstuck his throat.\n",
      "\"I always stay at Hogwarts for the Christmas and Easter holidays,\" he\n",
      "said, \"and I don't ever want to go back to Privet Drive.\"\n",
      "\"Now, now, I'm sure you'll feel differently once you've calmed down,\"\n",
      "said Fudge in a worried tone. \"They are your family, after all, and I'm\n",
      "sure you are fond of each other er very deep down.\"\n",
      "It didn't occur to Harry to put Fudge right. He was still waiting to\n",
      "hear what was going to happen to him now.\n",
      "\"So all that remains,\" said Fudge, now buttering himself a second\n",
      "crumpet, \"is to decide where you're going to spend the last two weeks of\n",
      "your vacation. I suggest you take a room here at the Leaky Cauldron and\n",
      "\"Hang on,\" blurted Harry. \"What about my punishment?\"\n",
      "Fudge blinked. \"Punishment?\"\n",
      "\"I broke the law!\" Harry said. \"The Decree for the Restriction of\n",
      "Underage Wizardry!\"\n",
      "\"Oh, my dear boy, we're not going to punish you for a little thing like\n",
      "that!\" cried Fudge, waving his crumpet impatiently. \"It was an accident!\n",
      "We don't send people to Azkaban just for blowing up their aunts!\"\n",
      "But this didn't tally at all with Harry's past dealings with the\n",
      "Ministry of Magic.\n",
      "\"Last year, I got an official warning just because a house-elf smashed a\n",
      "pudding in my uncle's house!\" he told Fudge, frowning. \"The Ministry of\n",
      "Magic said I'd be expelled from Hogwarts if there was any more magic\n",
      "there!\"\n",
      "Unless Harry's eyes were deceiving him, Fudge was suddenly looking\n",
      "awkward.\n",
      "\"Circumstances change, Harry... We have to take into account... in the\n",
      "present climate... Surely you don't want to be expelled?\"\n",
      "37\n",
      "\"Of course I don't,\" said Harry.\n",
      "\"Well then, what's A the fuss about?\" laughed Fudge. \"Now, have a\n",
      "crumpet, Harry, while I go and see if Tom's got a room for you.\"\n",
      "Fudge strode out of the parlor and Harry stared after him. There was\n",
      "something extremely odd going on. Why had Fudge been waiting for him at\n",
      "the Leaky Cauldron, if not to punish him for what he'd done? And now\n",
      "Harry came to think of it, surely it wasn't usual for the Minister of\n",
      "Magic himself to get involved in matters of underage magic?\n",
      "Fudge came back, accompanied by Tom the innkeeper.\n",
      "\"Room eleven's free, Harry,\" said Fudge. \"I think you'll be very\n",
      "comfortable. just one thing, and I'm sure you'll understand... I don't\n",
      "want you wandering off into Muggle London, all right? Keep to Diagon\n",
      "Alley. And you're to be back here before dark each night. Sure you'll\n",
      "understand. Tom will be keeping an eye on you for me.\"\n",
      "\"Okay,\" said Harry slowly, \"but why?\"\n",
      "\"Don't want to lose you again, do we?\" said Fudge with a hearty laugh.\n",
      "\"No, no... best we know where you are.... I mean...\"\n",
      "Fudge cleared his throat loudly and picked up his pinstriped cloak.\n",
      "\"Well, I'll be off, plenty to do, you\n",
      "know...\n",
      "\"Have you\n",
      "had any luck with Black yet?\" Harry asked.\n",
      "Fudge's finger slipped on the silver fastenings of his cloak.\n",
      "\"What's that? Oh, you've heard -- well, no, not yet, but it's only a\n",
      "matter of time. The Azkaban guards have never yet failed... and they are\n",
      "angrier than I've ever seen them.\"\n",
      "Fudge shuddered slightly.\n",
      "\"So, I'll say good-bye.\"\n",
      "38\n",
      "He held out his hand and Harry, shaking it, had a sudden idea.\n",
      "\"Er -- Minister? Can I ask you something?\"\n",
      "\"Certainly,\" said Fudge with a smile.\n",
      "\"Well, third years at Hogwarts are allowed to visit Hogsmeade, but my\n",
      "aunt and uncle didn't sign the permission form. D'you think you could\n",
      "--?\"\n",
      "Fudge was looking uncomfortable.\n",

      "Black stopped dead. It would have been impossible to say which face\n",
      "showed more hatred.\n",
      "Harry stood there, paralyzed, not knowing what to do or whom to believe.\n",
      "He glanced around at Ron and Hermione. Ron looked just as confused as he\n",
      "did, still fighting to keep hold on the struggling Scabbers. Hermione,\n",
      "300\n",
      "however, took an uncertain step toward Snape and said, in a very\n",
      "breathless voice, \"Professor Snape -- it it wouldn't hurt to hear what\n",
      "they've got to say, w -- would it?\"\n",
      "\"Miss Granger, you are already facing suspension from this school,\"\n",
      "Snape spat. \"You, Potter, and Weasley are out-of-bounds, in the company\n",
      "of a convicted murderer and a werewolf. For once in your life, hold your\n",
      "tongue.\"\n",
      "\"But if\n",
      "if there was a mistake\n",
      "\"KEEP QUIET, YOU STUPID GIRL!\" Snape shouted, looking suddenly quite\n",
      "deranged. \"DON'T TALK ABOUT WHAT YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND!\" A\n",
      "few sparks\n",
      "shot out of the end of his wand, which was still pointed at Black's\n",
      "face. Hermione fell silent.\n",
      "\"Vengeance is very sweet,\" Snape breathed at Black. \"How I hoped I would\n",
      "be the one to catch you....\"\n",
      "\"The joke's on you again, Severus,\" Black snarled. \"As long as this boy\n",
      "brings his rat up to the castle\" he jerked his head at Ron -- \"I'll\n",
      "come quietly....\"\n",
      "--\n",
      "\"Up to the castle?\" said Snape silkily. \"I don't think we need to go\n",
      "that far. All I have to do is call the dementors once we get out of the\n",
      "Willow. They'll be very pleased to see you, Black... pleased enough to\n",
      "give you a little kiss, I daresay... I --\"\n",
      "What little color there was in Blacks face left it.\n",
      "\"You -you've got to hear me out,\" he croaked. \"The rat -- look at the\n",
      "rat -\n",
      "But there was a mad glint in Snape's eyes that Harry had never seen\n",
      "before. He seemed beyond reason.\n",
      "\"Come on, all of you,\" he said. He clicked his fingers, and the ends of\n",
      "the cords that bound Lupin flew to his hands. \"I'll drag the werewolf.\n",
      "Perhaps the dementors will have a kiss for him too --\"\n",
      "301\n",
      "Before he knew what he was doing, Harry had crossed the room in three\n",
      "strides and blocked the door.\n",
      "\"Get out of the way, Potter, you're in enough trouble already,\" snarled\n",
      "Snape. \"If I hadn't been here to save your skin --\"\n",
      "\"Professor Lupin could have killed me about a hundred times this year,\"\n",
      "Harry said. \"I've been alone with him loads of times, having defense\n",
      "lessons against the dementors. If he was helping Black, why didn't he\n",
      "just finish me off then?\"\n",
      "\"Don't ask me to fathom the way a werewolf's mind works,\" hissed Snape.\n",
      "\"Get out of the way, Potter.\"\n",
      "\"YOURE PATHETIC!\" Harry yelled. \"JUST BECAUSE THEY MADE A FOOL\n",
      "OF YOU AT\n",
      "SCHOOL YOU WON'T EVEN LISTEN --\"\n",
      "\"SILENCE! I WILL NOT BE SPOKEN TO LIKE THAT!\" Snape shrieked,\n",
      "looking\n",
      "madder than ever. \"Like father, like son, Potter! I have just saved your\n",
      "neck; you should be thanking me on bended knee! You would have been well\n",
      "served if he'd killed you! You'd have died like your father, too\n",
      "arrogant to believe you might be mistaken in Black -- now get out of the\n",
      "way, or I will make you. GET OUT OF THE WAY, POTTER!\"\n",
      "Harry made up his mind in a split second. Before Snape could take even\n",
      "one step toward him, he had raised his wand.\n",
      "\"Expelliarmus!\" he yelled -- except that his wasn't the only voice that\n",
      "shouted. There was a blast that made the door rattle on its hinges;\n",
      "Snape was lifted off his feet and slammed into the wall, then slid down\n",
      "it to the floor, a trickle of blood oozing from under his hair. He had\n",
      "been knocked out.\n",
      "Harry looked around. Both Ron and Hermione had tried to disarm Snape at\n",
      "exactly the same moment. Snape's wand soared in a high arc and landed on\n",
      "the bed next to Crookshanks.\n",
      "302\n",
      "\"You shouldn't have done that,\" said Black, looking at Harry.\n",
      "\"You should have left him to me....\n",
      "Harry avoided Black's eyes. He wasn't sure, even now, that he'd done the\n",
      "right thing.\n",
      "\"We attacked a teacher... We attacked a teacher...\" Hermione whimpered,\n",
      "staring at the lifeless Snape with frightened eyes. \"Oh, we're going to\n",
      "be in so much trouble --\"\n",
      "Lupin was struggling against his bonds. Black bent down quickly and\n",
      "untied him. Lupin straightened up, rubbing his arms where the ropes had\n",
      "cut into them.\n",
      "\"Thank you, Harry,\" he said.\n",
      "\"I'm still not saying I believe you,\" he told Lupin.\n",
      "\"Then it's time we offered you some proof,\" said Lupin. \"You, boy --\n",
      "give me Peter, please. Now.\"\n",
      "Ron clutched Scabbers closer to his chest.\n",
      "\"Come off it,\" he said weakly. \"Are you trying to say he broke out of\n",
      "Azkaban just to get his hands on Scabbers? I mean...\" He looked up at\n",
      "Harry and Hermione for support, \"Okay, say Pettigrew could turn into a\n",
      "rat there are millions of rats -- how's he supposed to know which one\n",
      "he's after if he was locked up in Azkaban?\"\n",
      "\"You know, Sirius, that's a fair question,\" said Lupin, turning to Black\n",
      "and frowning slightly. \"How did you find out where he was?\"\n",
      "Black put one of his clawlike hands inside his robes and took out a\n",
      "crumpled piece of paper, which he smoothed flat and held out to show the\n",
      "others.\n",
      "It was the photograph of Ron and his family that had appeared in the\n",
      "Daily Prophet the previous summer, and there, on Ron's shoulder, was\n",
      "Scabbers.\n",
      "303\n",
      "\"How did you get this?\" Lupin asked Black, thunderstruck.\n",
      "\"Fudge,\" said Black. \"When he came to inspect Azkaban last year, he gave\n",
      "me his paper. And there was Peter, on the front page on this boy's\n",
      "shoulder... I knew him at once... how many times had I seen him\n",
      "transform? And the caption said the boy would be going back to\n",
      "Hogwarts... to where Harry was...\n",
      "\"My God,\" said Lupin softly, staring from Scabbers to the picture in the\n",
      "paper and back again. \"His front paw...\"\n",
      "\"What about it?\" said Ron defiantly.\n",
      "\"He's got a toe missing,\" said Black.\n",
      "\"Of course,\" Lupin breathed. \"So simple... so brilliant... he cut it off\n",
      "himself?\"\n",
      "\"Just before he transformed,\" said Black. \"When I cornered him, he\n",
      "yelled for the whole street to hear that I'd betrayed Lily and James.\n",
      "Then, before I could curse him, he blew apart the street with the wand\n",
      "behind his back, killed everyone within twenty feet of himself -- and\n",
      "sped down into the sewer with the other rats....\"\n",
      "\"Didn't you ever hear, Ron?\" said Lupin. \"The biggest bit of Peter they\n",
      "found was his finger.\"\n",
      "\"Look, Scabbers probably had a fight with another rat or something! He's\n",
      "been in my family for ages, right -\n",
      "\"Twelve years, in fact,\" said Lupin. \"Didn't you ever wonder why he was\n",
      "living so long?\"\n",
      "\"We -- we've been taking good care of him!\" said Ron.\n",
      "\"Not looking too good at the moment, though, is he?\" said Lupin. \"I'd\n",
      "guess he's been losing weight ever since he heard Sirius was on the\n",
      "loose again....\"\n",
      "304\n",
      "\"He's been scared of that mad cat!\" said Ron, nodding toward\n",
      "Crookshanks, who was still purring on the bed.\n",
      "But that wasn't right, Harry thought suddenly... Scabbers had been\n",
      "looking ill before he met Crookshanks... ever since Ron's return from\n",
      "Egypt... since the time when Black had escaped....\n",
      "\"This cat isn't mad,\" said Black hoarsely. He reached out a bony hand\n",
      "and stroked Crookshanks's fluffy head. \"He's the most intelligent of his\n",
      "kind I've ever met. He recognized Peter for what he was right away. And\n",
      "when he met me, he knew I was no dog. It was a while before he trusted\n",
      "me.... Finally, I managed to communicate to him what I was after, and\n",
      "he's been helping me. \"What do you mean?\" breathed Hermione.\n",
      "\"He tried to bring Peter to me, but couldn't... so he stole the\n",
      "passwords into Gryffindor Tower for me.... As I understand it, he took\n",
      "them from a boy's bedside table....\"\n",
      "Harry's brain seemed to be sagging under the weight of what he was\n",
      "hearing. It was absurd... and yet...\n",
      "\"But Peter got wind of what was going on and ran for it.\" croaked Black.\n",
      "\"This cat Crookshanks, did you call him? -- told me Peter had left\n",
      "blood on the sheets.... I supposed he bit himself... Well, faking his\n",
      "own death had worked once.\"\n",
      "These words jolted Harry to his senses.\n",
      "\"And why did he fake his death?\" he said furiously. \"Because he knew you\n",
      "were about to kill him like you killed my parents!\"\n",
      "\"No,\" said Lupin, \"Harry-\"\n",
      "\"And now you've come to finish him off!\"\n",
      "\"Yes, I have,\" said Black, with an evil look at Scabbers.\n",
      "\"Then I should've let Snape take you!\" Harry shouted.\n",
      "\"Harry,\" said Lupin hurriedly, \"don't you see? All this time we've\n",
      "305\n",
      "thought Sirius betrayed your parents, and Peter tracked him down -- but\n",
      "it was the other way around, don't you see? Peter betrayed your mother\n",
      "and father -- Sirius tracked Peter down --\"\n",
      "\"THAT'S NOT TRUE!\" Harry yelled. \"HE WAS THEIR SECRET-KEEPER! HE\n",
      "SAID SO\n",
      "BEFORE YOU TURNED UP. HE SAID HE KILLED THEM!\"\n",
      "He was pointing at Black, who shook his head slowly; the sunken eyes\n",
      "were suddenly over bright.\n",
      "\"Harry... I as good as killed them,\" he croaked. \"I persuaded Lily and\n",
      "James to change to Peter at the last moment, persuaded them to use him\n",
      "as Secret-Keeper instead of me.... I'm to blame, I know it.... The night\n",
      "they died, I'd arranged to check on Peter, make sure he was still safe,\n",
      "but when I arrived at his hiding place, he'd gone. Yet there was no sign\n",
      "of a struggle. It didn't feel right. I was scared. I set out for your\n",
      "parents' house straight away. And when I saw their house, destroyed, and\n",
      "their bodies... I realized what Peter must've done... what I'd done....\"\n",
      "His voice broke. He turned away.\n",
      "\"Enough of this,\" said Lupin, and there was a steely note in his voice\n",
      "Harry had never heard before. \"There's one certain way to prove what\n",
      "really happened. Ron, give me that rat.\"\n",
      "\"What are you going to do with him if I give him to you?\" Ron asked\n",
      "Lupin tensely.\n",
      "\"Force him to show himself,\" said Lupin. \"If he really is a rat, it\n",
      "won't hurt him.\"\n",
      "Ron hesitated. Then at long last, he held out Scabbers and Lupin took\n",
      "him. Scabbers began to squeak without stopping, twisting and turning,\n",
      "his tiny black eyes bulging in his head. \"Ready, Sirius?\" said Lupin.\n",
      "Black had already retrieved Snape's wand from the bed. He approached\n",
      "Lupin and the struggling rat, and his wet eyes suddenly seemed to be\n",
      "burning in his face.\n",
      "306\n",
      "\"Together?\" he said quietly.\n",
      "\"I think so,,, said Lupin, holding Scabbers tightly in one hand and his\n",
      "wand in the other. \"On the count of three. One -- two -- THREE!\"\n",
      "A flash of blue-white light erupted from both wands; for a moment,\n",
      "Scabbers was frozen in midair, his small gray form twisting madly -- Ron\n",
      "yelled -- the rat fell and hit the floor. There was another blinding\n",
      "flash of light and then --\n",
      "It was like watching a speeded-up film of a growing tree. A head was\n",
      "shooting upward from the ground; limbs were sprouting; a moment later, a\n",
      "man was standing where Scabbers had been, cringing and wringing his\n",
      "hands. Crookshanks was spitting and snarling on the bed; the hair on his\n",
      "back was standing up.\n",
      "He was a very short man, hardly taller than Harry and Hermione. His\n",
      "thin, colorless hair was unkempt and there was a large bald patch on\n",
      "top. He had the shrunken appearance of a plump man who has lost a lot of\n",
      "weight in a short time. His skin looked grubby, almost like Scabbers's\n",
      "fur, and something of the rat lingered around his pointed nose and his\n",
      "very small, watery eyes. He looked around at them all, his breathing\n",
      "fast and shallow. Harry saw his eyes dart to the door and back again.\n",
      "\"Well, hello, Peter,\" said Lupin pleasantly, as though rats frequently\n",
      "erupted into old school friends around him. \"Long time, no see.\n",
      "\"S -- Sirius... R -- Remus...\" Even Pettigrew's voice was squeaky.\n",
      "Again, his eyes darted toward the door. \"My friends... my old\n",
      "friends...\"\n",
      "Black's wand arm rose, but Lupin seized him around the wrist, gave him a\n",
      "warning took, then turned again to Pettigrew, his voice light and\n",
      "casual.\n",
      "\"We've been having a little chat, Peter, about what happened the night\n",
      "Lily and James died. You might have missed the finer points while you\n",
      "were squeaking around down there on the bed --\"\n",
      "\"Remus,\" gasped Pettigrew, and Harry could see beads of sweat breaking\n",
      "307\n",
      "out over his pasty face, \"you don't believe him, do you...? He tried to\n",
      "kill me, Remus....\"\n",
      "\"So we've heard,\" said Lupin, more coldly. \"I'd like to clear up one or\n",
      "two little matters with you, Peter, if you'll be so\n",
      "\"He's come to try and kill me again!\" Pettigrew squeaked suddenly,\n",
      "pointing at Black, and Harry saw that he used his middle finger, because\n",
      "his index was missing. \"He killed Lily and James and now he's going to\n",
      "kill me too.... You've got to help me, Remus....\"\n",
      "Black's face looked more skull-like than ever as he stared at Pettigrew\n",
      "with his fathomless eyes.\n",
      "\"No one's going to try and kill you until we've sorted a few things\n",
      "out,\" said Lupin.\n",
      "\"Sorted things out?\" squealed Pettigrew, looking wildly about him once\n",
      "more, eyes taking in the boarded windows and, again' the only door. \"I\n",
      "knew he'd come after me! I knew he'd be back for me! I've been waiting\n",
      "for this for twelve years!\"\n",
      "\"You knew Sirius was going to break out of Azkaban?\" said Lupin, his\n",
      "brow furrowed. \"When nobody has ever done it before?\"\n",
      "\"He's got dark powers the rest of us can only dream of!\" Pettigrew\n",
      "shouted shrilly. \"How else did he get out of there? I suppose\n",
      "He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named taught him a few tricks!\"\n",
      "Black started to laugh, a horrible, mirthless laugh that filled the\n",
      "whole room.\n",
      "\"Voldemort, teach me tricks?\" he said.\n",
      "Pettigrew flinched as though Black had brandished a whip at him.\n",
      "\"What, scared to hear your old master's name?\" said Black. I don't blame\n",
      "you, Peter. His lot aren't very happy with you, are they?\"\n",
      "\"Don't know what you mean, Sirius --\" muttered Pettigrew, his breathing\n",
      "308\n",
      "faster than ever. His whole face was shining with sweat now.\n",
      "\"You haven't been hiding from me for twelve years,\" said Black. \"You've\n",
      "been hiding from Voldemort's old supporters. I heard things in Azkaban,\n",
      "Peter... They all think you're dead, or you'd have to answer to them....\n",
      "I've heard them screaming all sorts of things in their sleep. Sounds\n",
      "like they think the double-crosser double-crossed them. Voldemort went\n",
      "to the Potters' on your information... and Voldemort met his downfall\n",
      "there. And not all Voldemort's supporters ended up in Azkaban, did they?\n",
      "There are still plenty out here, biding their time, pretending they've\n",
      "seen the error of their ways.\n",
      "If they ever got wind that you were still alive, Peter\n",
      "\"Don't know... what you're talking about...,\" said Pettigrew again, more\n",
      "shrilly than ever. He wiped his face on his sleeve and looked up at\n",
      "Lupin. \"You don't believe this this madness, Remus --\"\n",
      "--\n",
      "\"I must admit, Peter, I have difficulty in understanding why an innocent\n",
      "man would want to spend twelve years as a rat,\" said Lupin evenly.\n",
      "\"Innocent, but scared!\" squealed Pettigrew. \"If Voldemort's supporters\n",
      "were after me, it was because I put one of their best men in Azkaban --\n",
      "the spy, Sirius Black!\"\n",
      "Black's face contorted.\n",
      "\"How dare you,\" he growled, sounding suddenly like the bearsized dog he\n",

      "who were stronger and more powerful than myself? But you, Peter -- I'll\n",

      "Getting back into the tunnel was difficult. Lupin, Pettigrew, and Ron\n",

      "skirting around the Whomping Willow, tearing toward the shelter of the\n",
      "forest....\n",
      "Safe in the shadows of the trees, Harry turned around; seconds later,\n",
      "Hermione arrived beside him, panting.\n",
      "\"Right,\" she gasped. \"We need to sneak over to Hagrid's.... Keep out of\n",
      "sight, Harry....\"\n",
      "They made their way silently through the trees, keeping to the very edge\n",
      "of the forest. Then, as they glimpsed the front of Hagrid's house, they\n",
      "heard a knock upon his door. They moved quickly behind a wide oak trunk\n",
      "and peered out from either side. Hagrid had appeared in his doorway,\n",
      "shaking and white, looking around to see who had knocked. And Harry\n",
      "heard his own voice.\n",
      "\"It's us. We're wearing the Invisibility Cloak. Let us in and we can\n",
      "take it off.\"\n",
      "\"Yeh shouldn've come!\" Hagrid whispered. He stood back, then shut the\n",
      "door quickly.\n",
      "\"This is the weirdest thing we've ever done,\" Harry said fervently.\n",
      "334\n",
      "\"Let's move along a bit,\" Hermione whispered. \"We need to get nearer to\n",
      "Buckbeak!\"\n",
      "They crept through the trees until they saw the nervous hippogriff,\n",
      "tethered to the fence around Hagrid's pumpkin patch.\n",
      "\"Now?\" Harry whispered.\n",
      "\"No!\" said Hermione. \"If we steal him now, those Committee people will\n",
      "think Hagrid set him free! We've got to wait until they've seen he's\n",
      "tied outside!\"\n",
      "\"That's going to give us about sixty seconds,\" said Harry. This was\n",
      "starting to seem impossible.\n",
      "At that moment, there was a crash of breaking china from inside Hagrid's\n",
      "cabin.\n",
      "\"That's Hagrid breaking the milk jug,\" Hermione whispered. \"I'm going to\n",
      "find Scabbers in a moment --\"\n",
      "Sure enough, a few minutes later, they heard Hermione's shriek of\n",
      "surprise.\n",
      "\"Hermione,\" said Harry suddenly, \"what if we\n",
      "grab Pettigrew --\"\n",
      "——\n",
      "\"No!\" said Hermione in a terrified whisper. \"Don't you understand? We're\n",
      "breaking one of the most important wizarding laws! Nobody's supposed to\n",
      "change time, nobody! You heard Dumbledore, if we're seen --'\n",
      "\"We'd only be seen by ourselves and Hagrid!\"\n",
      "\"Harry, what do you think you'd do if you saw yourself bursting into\n",
      "Hagrid's house?\" said Hermione.\n",
      "\"1\n",
      "we just run in there and\n",
      "\"I'd -- I'd think I'd gone mad,\" said Harry, \"or I'd think there was\n",
      "some Dark Magic going on\n",
      "335\n",
      "\"Exactly! You wouldn't understand, you might even attack yourself! Don't\n",
      "you see? Professor McGonagall told me what awful things have happened\n",
      "when wizards have meddled with time.... Loads of them ended up killing\n",
      "their past or future selves by mistake!\"\n",
      "\"Okay!\" said Harry. \"It was just an idea, I just thought\n",
      "But Hermione nudged him and pointed toward the castle. Harry moved his\n",
      "head a few inches to get a clear view of the distant front doors.\n",
      "Dumbledore, Fudge, the old Committee member, and Macnair the executioner\n",
      "were coming down the steps.\n",
      "\"We're about to come out!\" Hermione breathed.\n",
      "And sure enough, moments later, Hagrid's back door opened, and Harry saw\n",
      "himself, Ron, and Hermione walking out of it with Hagrid. It was,\n",
      "without a doubt, the strangest sensation of his life, standing behind\n",
      "the tree, and watching himself in the pumpkin patch.\n",
      "\"It's Okay, Beaky, it's okay...\" Hagrid said to Buckbeak. Then he turned\n",
      "to Harry, Ron, and Hermione. \"Go on. Get goin'.\"\n",
      "\"Hagrid, we can't --\"\n",
      "\"We'll tell them what really happened\n",
      "\"They can't kill him --\"\n",
      "\"Go! It's bad enough without you lot in trouble an' all!\"\n",
      "Harry watched the Hermione in the pumpkin patch throw the Invisibility\n",
      "Cloak over him and Ron.\n",
      "\"Go quick. Don' listen....\"\n",
      "There was a knock on Hagrid's front door. The execution party had\n",
      "arrived. Hagrid turned, around and headed back into his cabin, leaving\n",
      "the back door ajar. Harry watched the grass flatten in patches all\n",
      "around the cabin and heard three pairs of feet retreating. He, Ron, and\n",
      "Hermione had gone... but the Harry and Hermione hidden in the trees\n",
      "336\n",
      "could now hear what was happening inside the cabin through the back\n",
      "door.\n",
      "\"Where is the beast?\" came the cold voice of Macnair.\n",
      "\"Out -- outside,\" Hagrid croaked.\n",
      "Harry pulled his head out of sight as Macnair's face appeared at\n",
      "Hagrid's window, staring out at Buckbeak. Then they heard Fudge.\n",
      "\"We er have to read you the official notice of execution, Hagrid.\n",
      "I'll make it quick. And then you and Macnair need to sign it. Macnair,\n",
      "You're supposed to listen too, that's procedure --\"\n",
      "Macnair's face vanished from the window. It was now or never.\n",
      "\"Wait here,\" Harry whispered to Hermione. \"I'll do it.\"\n",
      "As Fudge's voice started again, Harry darted out from behind his tree,\n",
      "vaulted the fence into the pumpkin patch, and approached Buckbeak.\n",
      "\"It is the decision of the Committee for the Disposal of Dangerous\n",
      "Creatures that the hippogriff Buckbeak, hereafter called the condemned,\n",
      "shall he executed on the sixth of June at sundown\n",
      "Careful not to blink, Harry stared up into Buckbeak's fierce orange eyes\n",
      "once more and bowed. Buckbeak sank to his scaly knees and then stood up\n",
      "again. Harry began to fumble with the knot of rope tying Buckbeak to the\n",
      "fence.\n",
      "\"1\n",
      "sentenced to execution by beheading, to be carried out by the\n",
      "Committee's appointed executioner, Walden Macnai...\"\n",
      "\"Come on, Buckbeak,\" Harry murmured, \"come on, we're going to help you.\n",
      "Quietly... quietly...\"\n",
      "\"... as witnessed below. Hagrid, you sign here...\"\n",
      "Harry threw all his weight onto the rope, but Buckbeak had dug in his\n",
      "front feet.\n",
      "337\n",
      "\"Well, let's get this over with,\" said the reedy voice of the Committee\n",
      "member from inside Hagrid's cabin. \"Hagrid, perhaps it will be better if\n",
      "you stay inside --\"\n",
      "\"No, I I wan' ter be with him.... I don' wan' him ter be alone --\"\n",
      "Footsteps echoed from within the cabin.\n",
      "\"Buckbeak, move!\" Harry hissed.\n",
      "Harry tugged harder on the rope around Buckbeak's neck. The hippogriff\n",
      "began to walk, rustling its wings irritably. They were still ten feet\n",
      "away from the forest, in plain view of Hagrid's back door. \"One moment,\n",
      "please, Macnair,\" came Dumbledore's voice. \"You need to sign too.\" The\n",
      "footsteps stopped. Harry heaved on the rope. Buckbeak snapped his beak\n",
      "and walked a little faster.\n",
      "Hermione's white face was sticking out from behind a tree.\n",
      "\"Harry, hurry!\" she mouthed.\n",
      "Harry could still hear Dumbledore's voice talking from within the cabin.\n",
      "He gave the rope another wrench. Buckbeak broke into a grudging trot.\n",
      "They had reached the trees....\n",
      "\"Quick! Quick!\" Hermione moaned, darting out from behind her tree,\n",
      "seizing the rope too and adding her weight to make Buckbeak move faster.\n",
      "Harry looked over his shoulder; they were now blocked from sight; they\n",
      "couldn't see Hagrid's garden at all.\n",
      "\"Stop!\" he whispered to Hermione. \"They might hear us\n",
      "Hagrid's back door had opened with a bang. Harry, Hermione, and Buckbeak\n",
      "stood quite still; even the hippogriff seemed to be listening intently.\n",
      "Silence... then -\n",
      "\"Where is it?\" said the reedy voice of the Committee member. \"Where is\n",
      "the beast?\"\n",
      "338\n",
      "\"It was tied here!\" said the executioner furiously. I saw it! just\n",
      "here!\"\n",
      "\"How extraordinary,\" said Dumbledore. There was a note of amusement in\n",
      "his voice.\n",
      "\"Beaky!\" said Hagrid huskily.\n",
      "There was a swishing noise, and the thud of an axe. The executioner\n",
      "seemed to have swung it into the fence in anger. And then came the\n",
      "howling, and this time they could hear Hagrid's words through his sobs.\n",
      "\"Gone! Gone! Bless his little beak, he's gone! Musta pulled himself\n",
      "free! Beaky, yeh clever boy!\"\n",
      "Buckbeak started to strain against the rope, trying to get back to\n",
      "Hagrid. Harry and Hermione tightened their grip and dug their heels into\n",
      "the forest floor to stop him.\n",
      "\"Someone untied him!\" the executioner was snarling. \"We should search\n",
      "the grounds, the forest.\"\n",
      "\"Macnair, if Buckbeak has indeed been stolen, do you really think the\n",
      "thief will have led him away on foot?\" said Dumbledore, still sounding\n",
      "amused. \"Search the skies, if you will.... Hagrid, I could do with a cup\n",
      "of tea. Or a large brandy.\"\n",
      "\"O' -- o' course, Professor,\" said Hagrid, who sounded weak with\n",
      "happiness. \"Come in, come in....\"\n",
      "Harry and Hermione listened closely. They heard footsteps, the soft\n",
      "cursing of the executioner, the snap of the door, and then silence once\n",
      "more.\n",
      "\"Now what?\" whispered Harry, looking around.\n",
      "\"We'll have to hide in here,\" said Hermione, who looked very shaken. \"We\n",

      "\"Get away from him -- get away Scabbers, come here --\"\n",

      "watched himself and Hermione chasing after Ron. Then he saw Ron dive.\n",
      "\"Gotcha! Get off, you stinking cat --\n",
      "\"There's Sirius!\" said Harry. The great shape of the dog had bounded out\n",
      "from the roots of the Willow. They saw him bowl Harry over, then seize\n",
      "Ron....\n",
      "\"Looks even worse from here, doesn't it?\" said Harry, watching the dog\n",
      "pulling Ron into the roots. \"Ouch -- look, I just got walloped by the\n",
      "tree and so did you -- this is weird--\"\n",
      "The Whomping Willow was creaking and lashing out with its lower\n",
      "branches; they could see themselves darting here and there, trying to\n",

      "340\n",
      "\"And there we go...\" Harry muttered. \"We're in.\"\n",
      "The moment they disappeared, the tree began to move again. Seconds\n",
      "later, they heard footsteps quite close by. Dumbledore, Macnair, Fudge,\n",
      "and the old Committee member were making their way up to the castle.\n",
      "\"Right after we'd gone down into the passage!\" said Hermione. \"If only\n",
      "Dumbledore had come with us...\"\n",
      "\"Macnair and Fudge would've come too,\" said Harry bitterly. \"I bet you\n",
      "anything Fudge would've told Macnair to murder Sirius on the spot....\"\n",
      "They watched the four men climb the castle steps and disappear from\n",
      "view. For a few minutes the scene was deserted. Then -\n",
      "--\n",
      "\"Here comes Lupin!\" said Harry as they saw another figure sprinting down\n",
      "the stone steps and hating toward the Willow. Harry looked up at the\n",
      "sky. Clouds were obscuring the moon completely.\n",
      "They watched Lupin seize a broken branch from the ground and prod the\n",
      "knot on the trunk. The tree stopped fighting, and Lupin, too,\n",
      "disappeared into the gap in its roots.\n",
      "\"If he'd only grabbed the cloak,\" said Harry. \"It's just lying\n",
      "there....\"\n",
      "He turned to Hermione.\n",

      "\"Harry, we mustn't be seen!\"\n",

      "cloak!\"\n",
      "\"Harry, no!\"\n",
      "341\n",
      "Hermione seized the back of Harry's robes not a moment too soon. just\n",
      "then, they heard a burst of song. It was Hagrid, making his way up to\n",
      "the castle, singing at the top of his voice, and weaving slightly as he\n",
      "walked. A large bottle was swinging from his hands.\n",
      "\"See?\" Hermione whispered. \"See what would have happened? We've got to\n",
      "keep out of sight! No, Buckbeak!\"\n",
      "The hippogriff was making frantic attempts to get to Hagrid again; Harry\n",

      "Hagrid meander tipsily up to the castle. He was gone. Buckbeak stopped\n",
      "fighting to get away. His head drooped sadly.\n",
      "Barely two minutes later, the castle doors flew open yet again, and\n",
      "Snape came charging out of them, running toward the Willow.\n",
      "Harry's fists clenched as they watched Snape skid to a halt next to the\n",
      "tree, looking around. He grabbed the cloak and held it up.\n",
      "\"Get your filthy hands off it,\" Harry snarled under his breath. \"Shh!\"\n",
      "Snape seized the branch Lupin had used to freeze the tree, prodded the\n",
      "knot, and vanished from view as he put on the cloak.\n",
      "\"So that's it,\" said Hermione quietly. \"We're all down there... and now\n",
      "we've just got to wait until we come back up again....\"\n",
      "She took the end of Buckbeak's rope and tied it securely around the\n",
      "nearest tree, then sat down on the dry ground, arms around her knees.\n",
      "\"Harry, there's something I don't understand.... Why didn't the\n",
      "dementors get Sirius? I remember them coming, and then I think I passed\n",
      "out... there were so many of them....\"\n",
      "Harry sat down too. He explained what he'd seen; how, as the nearest\n",
      "dementor had lowered its mouth to Harry's, a large silver something had\n",
      "come galloping across the lake and forced the dementors to retreat.\n",

      "\"But what was it?\"\n",
      "\"There's only one thing it could have been, to make the dementors go,\"\n",
      "said Harry. \"A real Patronus. A powerful one.\"\n",
      "\"But who conjured it?\"\n",
      "Harry didn't say anything. He was thinking back to the person he'd seen\n",
      "on the other bank of the lake. He knew who he thought it had been... but\n",
      "how could it have been?\n",
      "\"Didn't you see what they looked like?\" said Hermione eagerly. \"Was it\n",
      "one of the teachers?\"\n",
      "\"No,\" said Harry. \"He wasn't a teacher.\"\n",
      "\"But it must have been a really powerful wizard, to drive all those\n",
      "dementors away... If the Patronus was shining so brightly, didn't it\n",
      "light him up? Couldn't you see --?\"\n",
      "\"Yeah, I saw him,\" said Harry slowly. \"But... maybe I imagined it.... I\n",
      "wasn't thinking straight.... I passed out right afterward....\"\n",
      "\"Who did you think it was?\"\n",
      "I think --\" Harry swallowed, knowing how strange this was going to\n",
      "sound. I think it was my dad.\"\n",
      "Harry glanced up at Hermione and saw that her mouth was fully open now.\n",
      "She was gazing at him with a mixture of alarm and pity.\n",
      "\"Harry, your dad's -- well -- dead,\" she said quietly.\n",
      "\"I know that,\" said Harry quickly.\n",
      "\"You think you saw his ghost?\"\n",
      "\"I don't know... no... he looked solid....\"\n",
      "\"But then --'\n",
      "343\n",
      "\"Maybe I was seeing things,\" said Harry. \"But... from what I could\n",
      "see... it looked like him.... I've got photos of him....\"\n",
      "Hermione was still looking at him as though worried about his sanity.\n",
      "I know it sounds crazy,\" said Harry flatly. He turned to took at\n",
      "Buckbeak, who was digging his beak into the ground, apparently searching\n",
      "for worms. But he wasn't really watching Buckbeak.\n",
      "He was thinking about his father and about his father's three oldest\n",
      "friends... Moony, Wormtail, Padfoot, and Prongs.... Had all four of them\n",
      "been out on the grounds tonight? Wormtail had reappeared this evening\n",
      "when everyone had thought he was dead.... Was it so impossible his\n",
      "father had done the same? Had he been seeing things across the take? The\n",
      "figure had been too far away to see distinctly... yet he had felt sure,\n",
      "for a moment, before he'd lost consciousness....\n",
      "The leaves overhead rustled faintly in the breeze. The moon drifted in\n",
      "and out of sight behind the shifting clouds. Hermione sat with her face\n",
      "turned toward the Willow, waiting.\n",
      "And then, at last, after over an hour...\n",
      "\"Here we come!\" Hermione whispered.\n",
      "She and Harry got to their feet. Buckbeak raised his head. They saw\n",
      "Lupin, Ron, and Pettigrew clambering awkwardly out of the hole in the\n",
      "roots. Then came Hermione... then the unconscious Snape, drifting\n",
      "weirdly upward. Next came Harry and Black. They all began to walk toward\n",
      "the castle.\n",
      "Harry's heart was starting to beat very fast. He glanced up at the sky.\n",
      "Any moment now, that cloud was going to move aside and show the moon....\n",
      "\"Harry,\" Hermione muttered as though she knew exactly what he was\n",
      "thinking, \"we've got to stay put. We mustn't be seen. There's nothing we\n",
      "can do....\"\n",
      "\"So we're just going to let Pettigrew escape all over again.. said Harry\n",

      "quietly.\n",
      "\"How do you expect to find a rat in the dark?\" snapped Hermione.\n",
      "\"There's nothing we can do! We came back to help Sirius; we're not\n",
      "supposed to be doing anything else!\"\n",
      "\"All right!\"\n",
      "The moon slid out from behind its cloud. They saw the tiny figures\n",
      "across the grounds stop. Then they saw movement -\n",
      "\"There goes Lupin,\" Hermione whispered. \"He's transforming\n",
      "\"Hermione!\" said Harry suddenly. \"We've got to move!\"\n",
      "\"We mustn't, I keep telling you --\"\n",
      "\"Not to interfere! Lupin's going to run into the forest, right at us!\"\n",
      "Hermione gasped.\n",
      "\"Quick!\" she moaned, dashing to untie Buckbeak. \"Quick! Where are we\n",
      "going to go? Where are we going to hide? The dementors wilt be coming\n",
      "any moment --\n",
      "\"Back to Hagrid's!\" Harry said. \"It's empty now come on!\"\n",
      "They ran as fast as they could, Buckbeak cantering along behind them.\n",
      "They could hear the werewolf howling behind them....\n",
      "The cabin was in sight; Harry skidded to the door, wrenched it open, and\n",
      "Hermione and Buckbeak flashed past him; Harry threw himself in after\n",
      "them and bolted the door. Fang the boarhound barked loudly.\n",
      "\"Shh, Fang, it's us!\" said Hermione, hurrying over and scratching his\n",
      "ears to quieten him. \"That was really close!\" she said to Harry.\n",
      "\"Yeah...\"\n",
      "Harry was looking out of the window. It was much harder to see what was\n",
      "345\n",
      "going on from here. Buckbeak seemed very happy to find himself back\n",
      "inside Hagrid's house. He lay down in front of the fire, folded his\n",
      "wings contentedly, and seemed ready for a good nap.\n",
      "\"I think I'd better go outside again, you know,\" said Harry slowly. \"I\n",

      "rescue Sirius?\"\n",
      "\"Well... okay, then... I'll wait here with Buckbeak... but Harry, be\n",
      "careful -- there's a werewolf out there and the dementors\n",
      "--\n",
      "Harry stepped outside again and edged around the cabin. He could hear\n",

      "moment....\n",
      "For a fraction of a second he stood, irresolute, in front of Hagrid's\n",
      "door. You must not be seen. But he didn't want to be seen. He wanted to\n",
      "do the seeing.... He had to know...\n",
      "And there were the dementors. They were emerging out of the darkness\n",
      "from every direction, gliding around the edges of the lake.... They were\n",
      "moving away from where Harry stood, to the opposite bank.... He wouldn't\n",
      "have to get near them....\n",
      "Harry began to run. He had no thought in his head except his father...\n",
      "If it was him... if it really was him... he had to know, had to find\n",
      "out....\n",
      "The lake was coming nearer and nearer, but there was no sign of anybody.\n",
      "On the opposite bank, he could see tiny glimmers of silver\n",
      "his own\n",
      "attempts at a Patronus\n",
      "346\n",
      "==\n",
      "There was a bush at the very edge of the water. Harry threw himself\n",
      "behind it, peering desperately through the leaves. On the opposite bank,\n",
      "the glimmers of silver were suddenly extinguished. A terrified\n",
      "excitement shot through him -- any moment now\n",
      "\"Come on!\" he muttered, staring about. \"Where are you? Dad, come on\n",
      "But no one came. Harry raised his head to look at the circle of\n",
      "dementors across the lake. One of them was lowering its hood. It was\n",
      "time for the rescuer to appear -- but no one was coming to help this\n",
      "time --\n",
      "And then it hit him he understood. He hadn't seen his father -- he\n",
      "had seen himself --\n",
      "Harry flung himself out from behind the bush and pulled out his wand.\n",
      "\"EXPECTO PATRONUM! \"he yelled.\n",
      "And out of the end of his wand burst, not a shapeless cloud of mist, but\n",
      "a blinding, dazzling, silver animal. He screwed up his eyes, trying to\n",
      "see what it was. It looked like a horse. It was galloping silently away\n",
      "from him, across the black surface of the lake. He saw it lower its head\n",
      "and charge at the swarming dementors.... Now it was galloping around and\n",
      "around the black shapes on the ground, and the dementors were falling\n",
      "back, scattering, retreating into the darkness.... They were gone.\n",
      "The Patronus turned. It was cantering back toward Harry across the still\n",
      "surface of the water. It wasn't a horse. It wasn't a unicorn, either. It\n",
      "was a stag. It was shining brightly as the moon above ... it was coming\n",
      "back to him....\n",
      "It stopped on the bank. Its hooves made no mark on the soft ground as it\n",
      "stared at Harry with its large, silver eyes. Slowly, it bowed its\n",
      "antlered head. And Harry realized... \"Prongs, \"he whispered.\n",
      "But as his trembling fingertips stretched toward the creature, it\n",
      "vanished.\n",
      "347\n",
      "Harry stood there, hand still outstretched. Then, with a great leap of\n",
      "his heart, he heard hooves behind him -he whirled around and saw\n",
      "Hermione dashing toward him, dragging Buckbeak behind her.\n",
      "\"What did you do?\" she said fiercely. \"You said you were only going to\n",
      "keep a lookout!\"\n",
      "\"I just saved all our lives...,\" said Harry. \"Get behind here behind\n",
      "this bush -- I'll explain.\"\n",
      "Hermione listened to what had just happened with her mouth open yet\n",
      "again.\n",

      "\"Yes, haven't you been listening? I saw me but I thought I was my dad!\n",
      "It's okay!\"\n",
      "\"Harry, I can't believe it.... You conjured up a Patronus that drove\n",
      "away all those dementors! That's very, very advanced magic. I knew I\n",
      "could do it this time,\" said Harry, \"because I'd already done it....\n",
      "Does that make sense?\"\n",
      "\"I don't know -- Harry, look at Snape!\"\n",
      "Together they peered around the bush at the other bank. Snape had\n",
      "regained consciousness. He was conjuring stretchers and lifting the limp\n",
      "forms of Harry, Hermione, and Black onto them. A fourth stretcher, no\n",
      "doubt bearing Ron, was already floating at his side. Then, wand held out\n",
      "in front of him, he moved them away toward the castle.\n",
      "\"Right, it's nearly time,\" said Hermione tensely, looking at her watch.\n",
      "\"We've got about forty-five minutes until Dumbledore locks the door to\n",

      "before anybody realizes we're missing….... 11\n",
      "They waited, watching the moving clouds reflected in the lake, while the\n",

      "ferreting for worms again.\n",
      "348\n",
      "\"D' you reckon he's up there yet?\" said Harry, checking his watch. He\n",

      "\"Look!\" Hermione whispered. \"\\Who's that? Someone's coming back out of\n",
      "the castle!\"\n",
      "Harry stared through the darkness. The man was hurrying across the\n",

      "and tied it to the other side of his collar like reins.\n",
      "\"Ready?\" he whispered to Hermione. \"YotM better hold on to me\n",

      "it. The owl was so small, in fact, that it kept tumbling over in the\n",

      "dropped its letter onto Harry's seat and began zooming around their\n",

      "task. Hedwig clicked her beak with a sort of dignified disapproval.\n",

      "\"What?\" said Ron and Hermione excitedly. \"Read it aloud!\"\n",
      "Dear Harry,\n",
      "I hope this finds you before you reach your aunt and uncle. I don't know\n",
      "whether they're used to owl post.\n",

      "falls into the wrong hands. I have some doubt about his reliability, but\n",

      "\"Yes, but he hadn't jinxed it, had he?\" said Ron. \"Ouch!\" The tiny owl,\n",
      "now hooting happily in his hand, had nibbled one of his fingers in what\n",

      "I'll write again soon.\n",

      "my fault\n",
      "Ron's eyes widened. The minute owl was still hooting excitedly. \"Keep\n",

      "Mr. Weasley, who worked at the Ministry of Magic, would of course have\n",
      "heard the whole story of what had happened to Aunt Marge.\n",
      "\"Did you really blow up your aunt, Harry?\" said Hermione in a very\n",

      "-- lost control.\"\n",
      "\"It's not funny, Ron,\" said Hermione sharply. \"Honestly, I'm amazed\n",
      "Harry wasn't expelled.\"\n",
      "\"So am I,\" admitted Harry. \"Forget expelled, I thought I was going to be\n",

      "off, does he?\"\n",
      "\"Probably 'cause it's you, isn't it?\" shrugged Ron, still chuckling.\n",
      "\"Famous Harry Potter and all that. I'd hate to see what the Ministry'd\n",

      "\"Look at this,\" said Ron, pulling a long thin box out of a bag and\n",
      "opening it. \"Brand-new wand. Fourteen inches, willow, containing one\n",

      "\"Are you planning to eat or sleep at all this year, Hermione?\" asked\n",
      "Harry, while Ron sniggered. Hermione ignored them.\n",
      "\"I've still got ten Galleons,\" she said, checking her purse. \"It's my\n",

      "an early birthday present.\"\n",
      "\"How about a nice book? said Ron innocently.\n",
      "\"No, I don't think so,\" said Hermione composedly. \"I really want an owl.\n",
      "I mean, Harry's got Hedwig and you've got Errol --\"\n",
      "\"I haven't,\" said Ron. \"Errol's a family owl. All I've got is Scabbers.\"\n",
      "He pulled his pet rat out of his pocket. \"And I want to get him checked\n",
      "over,\" he added, placing Scabbers on the table in front of them. \"I\n",
      "don't think Egypt agreed with him.\"\n",
      "Scabbers was looking thinner than usual, and there was a definite droop\n",
      "to his whiskers.\n",
      "\"There's a magical creature shop just over there,\" said Harry, who knew\n",
      "Diagon Alley very well by now. \"You could see if they've got anything\n",
      "for Scabbers, and Hermione can get her owl,\"\n",
      "So they paid for their ice cream and crossed the street to the Magical\n",

      "47\n",
      "There wasn't much room inside. Every inch of wall was hidden by cages.\n",
      "It was smelly and very noisy because the occupants Of these cages were\n",
      "all squeaking, squawking, jabbering, or hissing. The witch behind the\n",
      "counter was already advising a wizard on the care of double-ended newts,\n",
      "so Harry, Ron, and Hermione waited, examining the cages.\n",
      "A pair of enormous purple toads sat gulping wetly and feasting on dead\n",
      "blowflies. A gigantic tortoise with a jewel-encrusted shell was\n",
      "glittering near the window. Poisonous orange snails were oozing slowly\n",
      "up the side of their glass tank, and a fat white rabbit kept changing\n",
      "into a silk top hat and back again with a loud popping noise. Then there\n",
      "were cats of every color, a noisy cage of ravens, a basket of funny\n",
      "custard-colored furballs that were humming loudly, and on the counter, a\n",
      "vast cage of sleek black rats that were playing some sort of skipping\n",
      "game using their long, bald tails.\n",
      "The double-ended newt wizard left, and Ron approached the counter.\n",
      "\"It's my rat,\" he told the witch. \"He been a bit off-color ever since I\n",
      "brought him back from Egypt.\"\n",
      "\"Bang him on the counter,\" said the witch, pulling a pair of heavy black\n",
      "spectacles out of her pocket.\n",
      "Ron lifted Scabbers out of his inside pocket and placed him next to the\n",
      "cage of his fellow rats, who stopped their skipping tricks and scuffled\n",
      "to the wire for a better took.\n",
      "Like nearly everything Ron owned, Scabbers the rat was secondhand (he\n",
      "had once belonged to Ron's brother Percy) and a bit battered. Next to\n",
      "the glossy rats in the cage, he looked especially woebegone.\n",
      "\"Hm,\" said the witch, picking up Scabbers. \"How old is this rat?\"\n",
      "\"Dunno,\" said Ron. \"Quite old. He used to belong to my brother.\"\n",
      "\"What powers does he have?\" said the witch, examining Scabbers closely.\n",
      "\"Er --\" The truth was that Scabbers had never shown the faintest trace\n",
      "of interesting powers. The witchs eyes moved from Scabbers's tattered\n",
      "48\n",
      "left ear to his front paw, which had a toe missing, and tutted loudly.\n",
      "\"He's been through the mill, this one,\" she said.\n",
      "\"He was like that when Percy gave him to me,\" said Ron defensively.\n",
      "\"An ordinary common or garden rat like this can't be expected to live\n",
      "longer than three years or so,\" said the witch. \"Now, if you were\n",
      "looking for something a bit more hard-wearing, you might like one of\n",
      "these --\"\n",
      "She indicated the black rats, who promptly started skipping again. Ron\n",
      "muttered, \"Show-offs.\"\n",
      "\"Well, if you Don't want a replacement, you can try this rat tonic,\"\n",
      "said the witch, reaching under the counter and bringing out a small red\n",
      "bottle.\n",
      "\"Okay,\" said Ron. \"How much -- OUCH!\"\n",
      "Ron buckled as something huge and orange came soaring from the top of\n",
      "the highest cage, landed on his head, and then propelled itself,\n",
      "spitting madly, at Scabbers.\n",
      "\"NO, CROOKSHANKS, NO!\" cried the witch, but Scabbers, shot from between\n",
      "her hands like a bar of soap, landed splay-legged on the floor, and then\n",
      "scampered for the door.\n",

      "That was a matter of opinion, thought Harry. The cat's ginger fur was\n",

      "with one curse; Mr. and Mrs, Weasley obviously thought Harry would be\n",
      "panic-stricken if he knew the truth. But Harry happened to agree\n",

      "remote.\n",

      "You've found out.\"\n",
      "\"What d'you mean?\" said Ron.\n",
      "\"I can't go. The Dursleys didn't sign my permission form, and Fudge\n",
      "wouldn't either.\"\n",
      "Ron looked horrified.\n",
      "\"\"You're not allowed to come? But no way -- McGonagall or someone\n",
      "will give you permission -- \" musclely; Crabbe was taller, with a\n",

      "spotted Lupin.\n",
      "\"New teacher,\" said Harry, who got to his feet, too, in case he needed\n",
      "to hold Ron back. \"What were you saying, Malfoy?\"\n",

      "flickered into life all along the corridors and over the luggage racks.\n",
      "The train rattled, the rain hammered, the ind roared, but still,\n",

      "fell away, the wind and rain sounded louder than ever against the\n",
      "windows.\n",
      "Harry, who was nearest the door, got up to look into the corridor. All\n",
      "along the carriage, heads were sticking curiously out of their\n",
      "compartments.\n",
      "The train came to a stop with a jolt, and distant thuds and bangs told\n",

      "all the lamps went out and they were plunged into total darkness.\n",
      "\"What's going on?\" said Ron's voice from behind Harry.\n",

      "\"D'you think we've broken down?\"\n",
      "\"Dunno...\"\n",
      "There was a squeaking sound, and Harry saw the dim black outline of Ron,\n",
      "wiping a patch clean on the window and peering out.\n",
      "\"There's something moving out there,\" Ron said. \"I think people are\n",
      "coming aboard....\"\n",

      "\"Harry? Is that you? What's happening?\"\n",
      "\"No idea -- sit down --\"\n",

      "Crookshanks.\n",
      "\"I'm going to go and ask the driver what's going on,\" came Hermione's\n",

      "\"Who's that?\"\n",
      "\"Who's that?\"\n",

      "\"Ouch!\" said Neville.\n",
      "\"Come in and sit down --\"\n",
      "\"Quiet!\" said a hoarse voice suddenly.\n",
      "Professor Lupin appeared to have woken up at last. Harry could hear\n",
      "movements in his corner.\n",
      "None of them spoke.\n",
      "There was a soft, crackling noise, and a shivering light filled the\n",
      "compartment. Professor Lupin appeared to be holding a handful of flames.\n",
      "They illuminated his tired, gray face, but his eyes looked alert and\n",
      "66\n",
      "wary.\n",
      "\"Stay where you are,\" he said in the same hoarse voice, and he got\n",
      "slowly to his feet with his handful of fire held out in front of him.\n",
      "But the door slid slowly open before Lupin could reach it.\n",
      "Standing in the doorway, illuminated by the shivering flames in Lupin's\n",
      "hand, was a cloaked figure that towered to the ceiling. Its face was\n",
      "completely hidden beneath its hood. Harry's eyes darted downward, and\n",
      "what he saw made his stomach contract. There was a hand protruding from\n",
      "the cloak and it was glistening, grayish, slimy-looking, and scabbed,\n",
      "like something dead that had decayed in water...\n",
      "But it was visible only for a split second. As though the creature\n",
      "beneath the cloak sensed Harry's gaze, the hand was suddenly withdrawn\n",
      "into the folds of its black cloak.\n",
      "And then the thing beneath the hood, whatever it was, drew a long, slow,\n",
      "rattling breath, as though it were trying to suck something more than\n",
      "air from its surroundings.\n",
      "An intense cold swept over them all. Harry felt his own breath catch in\n",
      "his chest. The cold went deeper than his skin. It was inside his chest,\n",
      "it was inside his very heart....\n",
      "Harry's eyes rolled up into his head. He couldn't see. He was drowning\n",
      "in cold. There was a rushing in his ears as though of water. He was\n",
      "being dragged downward, the roaring growing louder. .\n",
      "And then, from far away, he heard screaming, terrible, terrified,\n",
      "pleading screams. He wanted to help whoever it was, he tried to move his\n",
      "arms, but couldn't... a thick white fog was swirling around him, inside\n",
      "him -\n",
      "\"Harry! Harry! Are you all right?\"\n",
      "Someone was slapping his face.\n",
      "\"W -- what?\"\n",
      "67\n",
      "Harry opened his eyes; there were lanterns above him, and the floor was\n",
      "shaking -- the Hogwarts Express was moving again and the lights had come\n",
      "back on. He seemed to have slid out of his seat onto the floor. Ron and\n",
      "Hermione were kneeling next to him, and above them he could see Neville\n",
      "and Professor Lupin watching. Harry felt very sick; when he put up his\n",
      "hand to push his glasses back on, he felt cold sweat on his face.\n",
      "Ron and Hermione heaved him back onto his seat.\n",
      "\"Are you okay?\" Ron asked nervously.\n",
      "\"Yeah,\" said Harry, looking quickly toward the door. The hooded creature\n",
      "had vanished. \"What happened? Where's that -- that thing? Who screamed?\"\n",
      "\"No one screamed,\" said Ron, more nervously still.\n",
      "Harry looked around the bright compartment. Ginny and Neville looked\n",
      "back at him, both very pale.\n",
      "\"But I heard screaming\n",
      "A loud snap made them all jump. Professor Lupin was breaking an enormous\n",
      "slab of chocolate into pieces.\n",
      "\"Here,\" he said to Harry, handing him a particularly large piece. \"Eat\n",
      "it. It'll help.\"\n",
      "Harry took the chocolate but didn't eat it.\n",
      "\"What was that thing?\" he asked Lupin.\n",
      "\"A dementor,\" said Lupin, who was ow giving chocolate to everyone else.\n",
      "\"One of the dementors of Azkaban.\"\n",
      "Everyone stared at him. Professor Lupin crumpled up the empty chocolate\n",
      "wrapper and put it in his pocket.\n",
      "\"Eat,\" he repeated. \"It'll help. I need to speak to the driver, excuse\n",
      "me...\n",
      "68\n",
      "He strolled past Harry and disappeared into the corridor.\n",
      "\"Are you sure you're okay, Harry?\" said Hermione, watching Harry\n",
      "anxiously.\n",
      "\"I Don't get it.... What happened?\" said Harry, wiping more sweat off\n",
      "his face.\n",
      "\"Well that thing the dementor stood there and looked around (I\n",
      "mean, I think it did, I couldn't see its face) -- and you\n",
      "you\n",
      "\"I thought you were having a fit or something,\" said Ron, who still\n",
      "looked scared. \"You went sort of rigid and fell out of your seat and\n",
      "started twitching -- 11\n",
      "\"And Professor Lupin stepped over you, and walked toward the dementor,\n",
      "and pulled out his wand,\" said Hermione, \"and he said, 'None of us is\n",
      "hiding Sirius Black under our cloaks. Go.' But the dementor didn't move,\n",
      "so Lupin muttered something, and a silvery thing shot out of his wand at\n",
      "it, and it turned around and sort of glided away....\"\n",
      "\"It was horrible,\" said Neville, in a higher voice than usual. \"Did YOU\n",
      "feel how cold it got when it came in?\"\n",
      "I felt weird,\" said Ron, shifting his shoulders uncomfortably. \"Like I'd\n",
      "never be cheerful again....\"\n",
      "Ginny, who was huddled in her corner looking nearly as bad as Harry\n",
      "felt, gave a small sob; Hermione went over and put a comforting arm\n",
      "around her.\n",
      "\"But didn't any of you -- fall off your seats?\" said Harry awkwardly.\n",
      "\"No,\" said Ron, looking anxiously at Harry again. \"Ginny was shaking\n",
      "like mad, though....\"\n",
      "Harry didn't understand. He felt weak and shivery, as though he were\n",
      "recovering from a bad bout of flu; he also felt the beginnings of shame.\n",

      "loudly from under his hat. It was freezing on the tiny platform; rain\n",

      "for their traditional journey across the lake.\n",
      "\"All right, you three?\" Hagrid yelled over the heads of the crowd. They\n",
      "waved at him, but had no chance to speak to him because the mass of\n",
      "people around them was shunting them away along the platform. Harry,\n",
      "Ron, and Hermione followed the rest of the school along the platform and\n",
      "out onto a rough mud track, where at least a hundred stagecoaches\n",

      "an invisible horse, because when they climbed inside and shut the door,\n",
      "the coach set off all by itself, bumping and swaying in procession.\n",

      "back into the lumpy seat and closed his eyes until they had passed the\n",
      "gates. The carriage picked up speed on the long, sloping drive up to the\n",

      "\"Of course you're not,\" said Madam Pomfrey absentmindedly, now taking\n",

      "\"What does he need?\" said Professor McGonagall crisply. \"Bed rest?\n",
      "Should he perhaps spend tonight in the hospital wing?\"\n",

      "strode off toward her empty seat at the staff table, and Harry and\n",
      "Hermione set off in the other direction, as quietly as possible, toward\n",
      "the Gryffindor table. People looked around at them as they passed along\n",
      "the back of the hall, and a few of them pointed at Harry. Had the story\n",
      "of his collapsing in front of the dementor traveled that fast?\n",

      "stood up to speak, and he broke off.\n",
      "Professor Dumbledore, though very old, always gave an impression of\n",
      "great energy. He had several feet of long silver hair and beard,\n",
      "half-moon spectacles, and an extremely crooked nose. He was often\n",
      "described as the greatest wizard of the age, but that wasn't why Harry\n",
      "respected him. You couldn't help trusting Albus Dumbledore, and as Harry\n",
      "watched him beaming around at the students, he felt really calm for the\n",

      "\"They are stationed at every entrance to the grounds,\" Dumbledore\n",
      "continued, \"and while they are with us, I must make it plain that nobody\n",
      "is to leave school without permission. Dementors are not to be fooled by\n",

      "prefects, and our new Head Boy and Girl, to make sure that no student\n",
      "runs afoul of the dementors,\" he said.\n",
      "Percy, who was sitting a few seats down from Harry, puffed out his chest\n",
      "again and stared around impressively. Dumbledore paused again; he looked\n",
      "very seriously around the hall, and nobody moved or made a sound.\n",
      "\"On a happier note,\" he continued, I am pleased to welcome two new\n",
      "teachers to our ranks this year.\n",
      "\"First, Professor Lupin, who has kindly consented to fill the post of\n",

      "There was some scattered, rather unenthusiastic applause. Only those who\n",
      "had been in the compartment on the train with Professor Lupin clapped\n",
      "hard, Harry among them. Professor Lupin looked particularly shabby next\n",
      "to all the other teachers in their best robes.\n",
      "\"Look at Snape!\" Ron hissed in Harry's ear.\n",
      "Professor Snape, the Potions master, was staring along the staff table\n",
      "at Professor Lupin. It was common knowledge that Snape,anted the\n",
      "Defense Against the Dark Arts job, but even Harry, who hated Snape, was\n",
      "startled at the expression twisting his thin, sallow face. it was beyond\n",
      "anger: it was loathing. Harry knew that expression only too well; it was\n",
      "the look Snape wore every time he set eyes on Harry.\n",
      "\"As to our second new appointment,\" Dumbledore continued as the lukewarm\n",
      "applause for Professor Lupin died away. \"Well, I am sorry to tell you\n",
      "75\n",
      "that Professor Kettleburn, our Care of Magical Creatures teacher,\n",
      "retired at the end of last year in order to enjoy more time with his\n",

      "Harry, Ron, and Hermione stared at one another, stunned. Then they\n",
      "joined in with the applause, which was tumultuous at the Gryffindor\n",

      "ruby-red in the face and staring down at his enormous hands, his wide\n",
      "grin hidden in the tangle of his black beard.\n",
      "\"We should've known!\" Ron roared, pounding the table. \"Who else would\n",
      "have assigned us a biting book?\"\n",
      "Harry, Ron, and Hermione were the last to stop clapping, and as\n",
      "Professor Dumbledore started speaking again, they saw that Hagrid was\n",
      "wiping his eyes on the tablecloth.\n",
      "\"Well, I think that's everything of importance,\" said Dumbledore. \"Let\n",
      "the feast begin!\"\n",
      "The golden plates and goblets before them filled suddenly with food and\n",
      "drink. Harry, suddenly ravenous, helped himself to everything he could\n",
      "reach and began to eat.\n",
      "It was a delicious feast; the hall echoed with talk, laughter, and the\n",
      "clatter of knives and forks. Harry, Ron, and Hermione, however, were\n",
      "eager for it to finish so that they could talk to Hagrid. They knew how\n",
      "much being made a teacher would mean to him. Hagrid wasn't a fully\n",
      "qualified wizard; he had been expelled from Hogwarts in his third year\n",
      "for a crime he had not committed. It had been Harry, Ron, and Hermione\n",
      "who had cleared Hagrid's name last year.\n",
      "At long last, when the last morsels of pumpkin tart had melted from the\n",
      "golden platters, Dumbledore gave the word that it was time for them all\n",
      "to go to bed, and they got their chance.\n",
      "\"Congratulations, Hagrid!\" Hermione squealed as they reached the\n",
      "teachers' table.\n",
      "76\n",
      "\"All down ter you three,\" said Hagrid, wiping his shining face on his\n",

      "divided toward their separate staircases. Harry climbed the spiral stair\n",
      "with no thought in his head except how glad he was to be back. They\n",

      "entertaining a large group of Slytherins with a very funny story. As\n",
      "they passed, Malfoy did a ridiculous impression of a swooning fit and\n",
      "there was a roar of laughter.\n",

      "\"You didn't pass out, though, did you?\" said Harry in a low voice.\n",

      "counterclockwise.\n",

      "\"Easy) now, Harry,\" said Hagrid quietly. \"Yeh've got eye contact, now\n",

      "Harry's eyes immediately began to water, but he didn't shut thern.\n",

      "Harry didn't feel much like exposing the back of his neck to Buckbeak,\n",
      "but he did as he was told. He gave a short bow and then looked up.\n",
      "The hippogriff was still staring haughtily at him. It didn't move.\n",
      "\"Ah,\" said Hagrid, sounding worried. \"Right -- back away, now, Harry,\n",
      "easy does it\n",
      "But then, to Harry's enormous surprise, the hippogriff suddenly bent its\n",
      "scaly front knees and sank into what was an unmistakable bow.\n",
      "\"Well done, Harry!\" said Hagrid, ecstatic. \"Right -- yeh can touch him!\n",
      "Pat his beak, go on!\"\n",
      "Feeling that a better reward would have been to back away, Harry moved\n",
      "slowly toward the hippogriff and reached out toward it. He patted the\n",
      "beak several times and the hippogriff closed its eyes lazily, as though\n",
      "enjoying it.\n",
      "The class broke into applause, all except for Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle,\n",
      "who were looking deeply disappointed.\n",
      "\"Righ' then, Harry,\" said Hagrid. \"I reckon he might' let yeh ride him!\"\n",
      "This was more than Harry had bargained for. He was used to a broomstick;\n",
      "but he wasn't sure a hippogriff would be quite the same.\n",
      "93\n",
      "\"Yeh climb up there, jus' behind the wing joint,\" said Hagrid, \"an' mind\n",
      "yeh don' pull any of his feathers out, he won' like that....\"\n",
      "Harry put his foot on the top of Buckbeaks wing and hoisted himself onto\n",
      "its back. Buckbeak stood up. Harry wasn't sure where to hold on;\n",
      "everything in front of him was covered with feathers.\n",
      "\"Go on, then\"\" roared Hagrid, slapping the hippogriffs hindquarters.\n",
      "Without warning, twelve-foot wings flapped open on either side of Harry,\n",
      "he just had time to seize the hippogriff around the neck before he was\n",
      "soaring upward. It was nothing like a broomstick, and Harry knew which\n",
      "one he preferred; the hippogriff's wings beat uncomfortably on either\n",
      "side of him, catching him under his legs and making him feel he was\n",
      "about to be thrown off; the glossy feathers slipped under his fingers\n",
      "and he didn't dare get a stronger grip; instead of the smooth action of\n",
      "his Nimbus Two Thousand, he now felt himself rocking backward and\n",
      "forward as the hindquarters of the hippogriff rose and fell with its\n",
      "wings.\n",
      "Buckbeak flew him once around the paddock and then headed back to the\n",
      "ground; this was the bit Harry had been dreading; he leaned back as the\n",
      "smooth neck lowered, feeling he was going to slip off over the beak,\n",
      "then felt a heavy thud as the four ill-assorted feet hit the ground. He\n",
      "just managed to hold on and push himself straight again.\n",
      "\"Good work, Harry!\" roared Hagrid as everyone except Malfoy, Crabbe, and\n",
      "Goyle cheered. \"Okay, who else wants a go?\"\n",
      "Emboldened by Harry's success, the rest of the class climbed cautiously\n",
      "into the paddock. Hagrid untied the hippogriffs one by one, and soon\n",
      "people were bowing nervously, all over the paddock. Neville ran\n",
      "repeatedly backward from his, which didn't seem to want to bend its\n",
      "knees. Ron and Hermione practiced on the chestnut, while Harry watched.\n",
      "Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle had taken over Buckbeak. He had bowed to\n",
      "Malfoy, who was now patting his beak, looking disdainful.\n",
      "\"This is very easy,\" Malfoy drawled, loud enough for Harry to, hear him.\n",
      "94\n",
      "\"I knew it must have been, if Potter could do it.... I bet you're not\n",
      "dangerous at all, are you?\" he said to the hippogriff. \"Are you, you\n",
      "great ugly brute?\"\n",
      "It happened in a flash of steely talons; Malfoy let out a highpitched\n",
      "scream and next moment, Hagrid was wrestling Buckbeak back into his\n",
      "collar as he strained to get at Malfoy, who lay curled in the grass,\n",
      "blood blossoming over his robes.\n",
      "\"I'm dying!\" Malfoy yelled as the class panicked. \"I'm dying, look at\n",
      "me! It's killed me!\"\n",
      "\"Yer not dyin'!\" said Hagrid, who had gone very white. \"Someone help me\n",
      "-- gotta get him outta here\n",
      "Hermione ran to hold open the gate as Hagrid lifted Malfoy easily. As\n",
      "they passed, Harry saw that there was a long, deep gash on Malfoy's arm;\n",
      "blood splattered the grass and Hagrid ran with him, up the slope toward\n",
      "the castle.\n",
      "Very shaken, the Care of Magical Creatures class followed at a walk. The\n",

      "\"They should fire him straight away!\" said Pansy Parkinson, who was in\n",
      "tears.\n",

      "their muscles threateningly.\n",
      "They all climbed the stone steps into the deserted entrance hall.\n",
      "\"I'm going to see if he's okay!\" said Pansy, and they all watched her\n",
      "run up the marble staircase. The Slytherins, still muttering about\n",
      "Hagrid, headed away in the direction of their dungeon common room;\n",
      "Harry, Ron, and Hermione proceeded upstairs to Gryffindor Tower.\n",
      "\"You think he'll be all right?\" said Hermione nervously.\n",
      "\"Course he will. Madam Pomfrey can mend cuts in about a second,\" said\n",

      "95\n",
      "\"That was a really bad thing to happen in Hagrid's first class, though,\n",
      "wasn't it?\" said Ron, looking worried. \"Trust Malfoy to mess things up\n",

      "They were among the first to reach the Great Hall at dinnertime, hoping\n",
      "to see Hagrid, but he wasn't there.\n",
      "\"They wouldn't fire him, would they?\" said Hermione anxiously, not\n",
      "touching her steak-and- kidney pudding.\n",
      "\"They'd better not,\" said Ron, who wasn't eating either.\n",
      "Harry was watching the Slytherin table. A large group including Crabbe\n",
      "and Goyle was huddled together, deep in conversation. Harry was sure\n",
      "they were cooking up their own version of how Malfoy had been injured.\n",
      "\"Well, you can't say it wasn't an interesting first day back,\" said Ron\n",
      "gloomily.\n",
      "They went up to the crowded Gryffindor common room after dinner and\n",
      "tried to do the homework Professor McGonagall had given them, but all\n",
      "three of them kept breaking off and glancing Out of the tower window.\n",
      "\"There's a light on in Hagrid's window,\" Harry said suddenly.\n",

      "\"If we hurried, we could go down and see him. It's still quite early...\"\n",
