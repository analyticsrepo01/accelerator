      "THE BOY WHO LIVED\n",
      "Mr. and Mrs. Dursley, of number four, Privet Drive, were proud to say\n",
      "that they were perfectly normal, thank you very much. They were the last people\n",
      "you'd expect to be involved in anything strange or mysterious, because they just\n",
      "didn't hold with such nonsense.\n",
      "Mr. Dursley was the director of a firm called Grunnings, which made\n",
      "drills. He was a big, beefy man with hardly any neck, although he did have a\n",
      "very large mustache. Mrs. Dursley was thin and blonde and had nearly twice the\n",
      "usual amount of neck, which came in very useful as she spent so much of her\n",
      "time craning over garden fences, spying on the neighbors. The Dursleys had a\n",
      "small son called Dudley and in their opinion there was no finer boy anywhere.\n",
      "The Dursleys had everything they wanted, but they also had a secret, and\n",
      "their greatest fear was that somebody would discover it. They didn’t think they\n",
      "could bear it if anyone found out about the Potters. Mrs. Potter was Mrs.\n",
      "Dursley's sister, but they hadn't met for several years; in fact, Mrs. Dursley\n",
      "pretended she didn't have a sister, because her sister and her good-for-nothing\n",
      "husband were as unDursleyish as it was possible to be. The Dursleys shuddered\n",
      "to think what the neighbors would say if the Potters arrived in the street. The\n",
      "Dursleys knew that the Potters had a small son, too, but they had never even\n",
      "seen him. This boy was another good reason for keeping the Potters away; they\n",
      "didn't want Dudley mixing with a child like that.\n",
      "When Mr. and Mrs. Dursley woke up on the dull, gray Tuesday our story\n",
      "starts, there was nothing about the cloudy sky outside to suggest that strange and\n",
      "mysterious things would soon be happening all over the country. Mr. Dursley\n",
      "hummed as he picked out his most boring tie for work, and Mrs. Dursley\n",
      "gossiped away happily as she wrestled a screaming Dudley into his high chair.\n",
      "None of them noticed a large, tawny owl flutter past the window.\n",
      "At half past eight, Mr. Dursley picked up his briefcase, pecked Mrs.\n",
      "Dursley on the cheek, and tried to kiss Dudley good-bye but missed, because\n",
      "Dudley was now having a tantrum and throwing his cereal at the walls.\n",
      "\"Little tyke,\" chortled Mr. Dursley as he left the house. He got into his car\n",
      "and backed out of number four's drive.\n",
      "It was on the corner of the street that he noticed the first sign of\n",
      "something peculiar a cat reading a map. For a second, Mr. Dursley didn't\n",
      "realize what he had seen - then he jerked his head around to look again. There\n",
      "was a tabby cat standing on the corner of Privet Drive, but there wasn't a map in\n",
      "sight. What could he have been thinking of? It must have been a trick of the\n",
      "light. Mr. Dursley blinked and stared at the cat. It stared back. As Mr. Dursley\n",
      "drove around the corner and up the road, he watched the cat in his mirror. It was\n",
      "now reading the sign that said Privet Drive - no, looking at the sign; cats\n",
      "couldn't read maps or signs. Mr. Dursley gave himself a little shake and put the\n",
      "cat out of his mind. As he drove toward town he thought of nothing except a\n",
      "large order of drills he was hoping to get that day.\n",
      "But on the edge of town, drills were driven out of his mind by something\n",
      "else. As he sat in the usual morning traffic jam, he couldn't help noticing that\n",
      "there seemed to be a lot of strangely dressed people about. People in cloaks. Mr.\n",
      "Dursley couldn't bear people who dressed in funny clothes the getups you\n",
      "saw on young people! He supposed this was some stupid new fashion. He\n",
      "drummed his fingers on the steering wheel and his eyes fell on a huddle of these\n",
      "weirdos standing quite close by. They were whispering excitedly together. Mr.\n",
      "Dursley was enraged to see that a couple of them weren't young at all; why, that\n",
      "man had to be older than he was, and wearing an emerald-green cloak! The\n",
      "nerve of him! But then it struck Mr. Dursley that this was probably some silly\n",
      "stunt-these people were obviously collecting for something...yes, that would\n",
      "be it. The traffic moved on and a few minutes later, Mr. Dursley arrived in the\n",
      "Grunnings parking lot, his mind back on drills.\n",
      "Mr. Dursley always sat with his back to the window in his office on the\n",
      "ninth floor. If he hadn’t, he might have found it harder to concentrate on drills\n",
      "that morning. He didn't see the owls swooping past in broad daylight, though\n",
      "people down in the street did; they pointed and gazed open-mouthed as owl after\n",
      "owl sped overhead. Most of them had never seen an owl even at nighttime. Mr.\n",
      "Dursley, however, had a perfectly normal, owl-free morning. He yelled at five\n",
      "different people. He made several important telephone calls and shouted a bit\n",
      "more. He was in a very good mood until lunchtime, when he thought he'd stretch\n",
      "his legs and walk across the road to buy himself a bun from the bakery.\n",
      "He'd for gotten all about the people in cloaks until he passed a group of\n",
      "them next to the baker's. He eyed them angrily as he passed. He didn't know\n",
      "why, but they made him uneasy. This bunch were whispering excitedly, too, and\n",
      "he couldn't see a single collecting tin. It was on his way back past them,\n",
      "clutching a large doughnut in a bag, that he caught a few words of what they\n",
      "were saying.\n",
      "\"The Potters, that's right, that's what I heard\n",
      "\"\"\n",
      "66\n",
      "99\n",
      "yes, their son, Harry -\n",
      "Mr. Dursley stopped dead. Fear flooded him. He looked back at the\n",
      "whisperers as if he wanted to say something to them, but thought better of it.\n",
      "He dashed back across the road, hurried up to his office, snapped at his\n",
      "secretary not to disturb him, seized his telephone, and had almost finished\n",
      "dialing his home number when he changed his mind. He put the receiver back\n",
      "down and stroked his mustache, thinking...no, he was being stupid. Potter\n",
      "wasn't such an unusual name. He was sure there were lots of people called Potter\n",
      "who had a son called Harry. Come to think of it, he wasn't even sure his nephew\n",
      "was called Harry. He'd never even seen the boy. It might have been Harvey. Or\n",
      "Harold. There was no point in worrying Mrs. Dursley; she always got so upset at\n",
      "any mention of her sister. He didn't blame her - if he'd had a sister like that…..\n",
      "but all the same, those people in cloaks…...\n",
      "He found it a lot harder to concentrate on drills that afternoon and when\n",
      "he left the building at five o'clock, he was still so worried that he walked straight\n",
      "into someone just outside the door.\n",
      "\"Sorry,\" he grunted, as the tiny old man stumbled and almost fell. It was\n",
      "a few seconds before Mr. Dursley realized that the man was wearing a violet\n",
      "cloak. He didn't seem at all upset at being almost knocked to the ground. On the\n",
      "contrary, his face split into a wide smile and he said in a squeaky voice that made\n",
      "passersby stare, \"Don't be sorry, my dear sir, for nothing could upset me today!\n",
      "Rejoice, for You-Know-Who has gone at last! Even Muggles like yourself\n",
      "should be celebrating, this happy, happy day!\"\n",
      "And the old man hugged Mr. Dursley around the middle and walked off.\n",
      "Mr. Dursley stood rooted to the spot. He had been hugged by a complete\n",
      "stranger. He also thought he had been called a Muggle, whatever that was. He\n",
      "was rattled. He hurried to his car and set off for home, hoping he was imagining\n",
      "things, which he had never hoped before, because he didn't approve of\n",
      "imagination.\n",
      "As he pulled into the driveway of number four, the first thing he saw\n",
      "and it didn't improve his mood- was the tabby cat he'd spotted that morning. It\n",
      "was now sitting on his garden wall. He was sure it was the same one; it had the\n",
      "same markings around its eyes.\n",
      "\"Shoo!\" said Mr. Dursley loudly.\n",
      "The cat didn't move. It just gave him a stern look. Was this normal cat\n",
      "behavior? Mr. Dursley wondered. Trying to pull himself together, he let himself\n",
      "into the house. He was still determined not to mention anything to his wife.\n",
      "Mrs. Dursley had had a nice, normal day. She told him over dinner all\n",
      "about Mrs. Next Door's problems with her daughter and how Dudley had\n",
      "learned a new word (\"Won't!\"). Mr. Dursley tried to act normally. When Dudley\n",
      "had been put to bed, he went into the living room in time to catch the last report\n",
      "on the evening news:\n",
      "\"And finally, bird-watchers everywhere have reported that the nation's\n",
      "owls have been behaving very unusually today. Although owls normally hunt at\n",
      "night and are hardly ever seen in daylight, there have been hundreds of sightings\n",
      "of these birds flying in every direction since sunrise. Experts are unable to\n",
      "explain why the owls have suddenly changed their sleeping pattern.\" The\n",
      "newscaster allowed himself a grin. “Most mysterious. And now, over to Jim\n",
      "McGuffin with the weather. Going to be any more showers of owls tonight,\n",
      "Jim?\"\n",
      "\"Well, Ted,\" said the weatherman, “I don't know about that, but it's not\n",
      "only the owls that have been acting oddly today. Viewers as far apart as Kent,\n",
      "Yorkshire, and Dundee have been phoning in to tell me that instead of the rain I\n",
      "promised yesterday, they've had a downpour of shooting stars! Perhaps people\n",

      "much as quiver when a car door slammed on the next street, nor when two owls\n",
      "swooped overhead. In fact, it was nearly midnight before the cat moved at all.\n",

      "suddenly and silently you'd have thought he'd just popped out of the ground.\n",
      "The cat's tail twitched and its eyes narrowed.\n",
      "Nothing like this man had ever been seen on Privet Drive. He was tall,\n",
      "thin, and very old, judging by the silver of his hair and beard, which were both\n",
      "long enough to tuck into his belt. He was wearing long robes, a purple cloak that\n",
      "swept the ground, and high-heeled, buckled boots. His blue eyes were light,\n",
      "bright, and sparkling behind half-moon spectacles and his nose was very long\n",
      "and crooked, as though it had been broken at least twice. This man's name was\n",
      "Albus Dumbledore.\n",
      "Albus Dumbledore didn't seem to realize that he had just arrived in a\n",

      "he was being watched, because he looked up suddenly at the cat, which was still\n",
      "staring at him from the other end of the street. For some reason, the sight of the\n",
      "cat seemed to amuse him. He chuckled and muttered, “I should have known.\"\n",
      "He found what he was looking for in his inside pocket. It seemed to be a\n",
      "silver cigarette lighter. He flicked it open, held it up in the air, and clicked it. The\n",
      "the next\n",
      "nearest street lamp went out with a little pop. He clicked it again\n",
      "lamp flickered into darkness. Twelve times he clicked the Put-Outer, until the\n",
      "only lights left on the whole street were two tiny pinpricks in the distance, which\n",
      "were the eyes of the cat watching him. If anyone looked out of their window\n",
      "now, even beady-eyed Mrs. Dursley, they wouldn't be able to see anything that\n",
      "was happening down on the pavement. Dumbledore slipped the Put-Outer back\n",
      "inside his cloak and set off down the street toward number four, where he sat\n",
      "down on the wall next to the cat. He didn't look at it, but after a moment he\n",
      "spoke to it.\n",
      "\"Fancy seeing you here, Professor McGonagall.\"\n",
      "He turned to smile at the tabby, but it had gone. Instead he was smiling at\n",
      "a rather severe-looking woman who was wearing square glasses exactly the\n",
      "shape of the markings the cat had had around its eyes. She, too, was wearing a\n",
      "cloak, an emerald one. Her black hair was drawn into a tight bun. She looked\n",
      "distinctly ruffled.\n",
      "\"How did you know it was me?\" she asked.\n",
      "\"My dear Professor, I've never seen a cat sit so stiffly.\"\n",
      "\"You'd be stiff if you'd been sitting on a brick wall all day,\" said\n",
      "Professor McGonagall.\n",
      "\"All day? When you could have been celebrating? I must have passed a\n",
      "dozen feasts and parties on my way here.\"\n",
      "Professor McGonagall sniffed angrily.\n",
      "\"Oh yes, I've celebrating, all right,\" she said impatiently. \"You'd think\n",
      "they'd be a bit more careful, but no -even the Muggles have noticed\n",
      "something's going on. It was on their news.” She jerked her head back at the\n",
      "Dursleys' dark living-room window. \"I heard it. Flocks of owls...shooting\n",
      "stars...Well, they're not completely stupid. They were bound to notice\n",
      "something. Shooting stars down in Kent - I'll bet that was Dedalus Diggle. He\n",
      "never had much sense.\"\n",
      "\"You can't blame them,\" said Dumbledore gently. \"We've had precious\n",
      "little to celebrate for eleven years.\"\n",
      "\"I know that,\" said Professor McGonagall irritably. “But that's no reason\n",
      "to lose our heads. People are being downright careless, out on the streets in\n",
      "broad daylight, not even dressed in Muggle clothes, swapping rumors.\"\n",
      "She threw a sharp, sideways glance at Dumbledore here, as though\n",
      "hoping he was going to tell her something, but he didn't, so she went on. \"A fine\n",
      "thing it would be if, on the very day You-Know-Who seems to have disappeared\n",
      "at last, the Muggles found out about us all. I suppose he really has gone,\n",
      "Dumbledore?\"\n",
      "\"It certainly seems so,” said Dumbledore. \"We have much to be thankful\n",
      "for. Would you care for a lemon drop?\"\n",
      "\"A what?\"\n",
      "\"A lemon drop. They're a kind of Muggle sweet I'm rather fond of.\"\n",
      "\"No, thank you,\" said Professor McGonagall coldly, as though she didn't\n",
      "think this was the moment for lemon drops. “As I say, even if You-Know-Who\n",
      "has gone\n",
      "99\n",

      "trying to persuade people to call him by his proper name: Voldemort.\" Professor\n",
      "McGonagall flinched, but Dumbledore, who was unsticking two lemon drops,\n",
      "seemed not to notice. “It all gets so confusing if we keep saying 'You-Know-\n",

      "exasperated, half admiring. \"But you're different. Everyone knows you're the\n",
      "only one You-Know- oh, all right, Voldemort, was frightened of.\"\n",
      "\"You flatter me,” said Dumbledore calmly. \"Voldemort had powers I will\n",
      "never have.\"\n",
      "\"Only because you're too— well — noble to use them.\"\n",
      "\"It's lucky it's dark. I haven't blushed so much since Madam Pomfrey\n",
      "told me she liked my new earmuffs.”\n",
      "Professor McGonagall shot a sharp look at Dumbledore and said \"The\n",
      "owls are nothing next to the rumors that are flying around. You know what\n",
      "they're saying? About why he's disappeared? About what finally stopped him?\"\n",
      "It seemed that Professor McGonagall had reached the point she was most\n",
      "anxious to discuss, the real reason she had been waiting on a cold, hard wall all\n",
      "day, for neither as a cat nor as a woman had she fixed Dumbledore with such a\n",
      "piercing stare as she did now. It was plain that whatever \"everyone\" was saying,\n",
      "she was not going to believe it until Dumbledore told her it was true.\n",
      "Dumbledore, however, was choosing another lemon drop and did not answer.\n",
      "\"What they're saying,” she pressed on, “is that last night Voldemort\n",
      "turned up in Godric's Hollow. He went to find the Potters. The rumor is that Lily\n",

      "are that they're - dead.\"\n",

      "Dumbledore reached out and patted her on the shoulder. \"I know...I\n",

      "couldn't kill that little boy. No one knows why, or how, but they're saying that\n",
      "when he couldn't kill Harry Potter, Voldemort's power somehow broke — and\n",
      "that's why he's gone.\"\n",

      "watch from his pocket and examined it. It was a very odd watch. It had twelve\n",
      "hands but no numbers; instead, little planets were moving around the edge. It\n",
      "must have made sense to Dumbledore, though, because he put it back in his\n",
      "pocket and said, “Hagrid's late. I suppose it was he who told you I'd be here, by\n",

      "his mother all the way up the street, screaming for sweets. Harry Potter come\n",
      "and live here!\"\n",
      "\"It's the best place for him,\" said Dumbledore firmly. \"His aunt and\n",

      "them a letter.”\n",
      "\"A letter?\" repeated Professor McGonagall faintly, sitting back down on\n",
      "the wall. \"Really, Dumbledore, you think you can explain all this in a letter?\n",
      "These people will never understand him! He'll be famous a legend - I\n",
      "wouldn't be surprised if today was known as Harry Potter day in the future-\n",
      "there will be books written about Harry every child in our world will know\n",
      "his name!\"\n",
      "\"Exactly.\" said Dumbledore, looking very seriously over the top of his\n",
      "half-moon glasses. \"It would be enough to turn any boy's head. Famous before\n",
      "he can walk and talk! Famous for something he won't even remember! Can you\n",

      "to take it?\"\n",
      "Professor McGonagall opened her mouth, changed her mind, swallowed,\n",
      "and then said, “Yes yes, you're right, of course. But how is the boy getting\n",

      "to what was that?\"\n",
      "A low rumbling sound had broken the silence around them. It grew\n",
      "steadily louder as they looked up and down the street for some sign of a\n",
      "headlight; it swelled to a roar as they both looked up at the sky — and a huge\n",
      "motorcycle fell out of the air and landed on the road in front of them.\n",
      "If the motorcycle was huge, it was nothing to the man sitting astride it.\n",
      "He was almost twice as tall as a normal man and at least five times as wide. He\n",
      "looked simply too big to be allowed, and so wild — long tangles of bushy black\n",
      "hair and beard hid most of his face, he had hands the size of trash can lids, and\n",
      "his feet in their leather boots were like baby dolphins. In his vast, muscular arms\n",
      "he was holding a bundle of blankets.\n",
      "\"Hagrid,\" said Dumbledore, sounding relieved. \"At last. And where did\n",
      "you get that motorcycle?\"\n",
      "\"Borrowed it, Professor Dumbledore, sir,\" said the giant, climbing\n",
      "carefully off the motorcycle as he spoke. \"Young Sirius Black lent it to me. I've\n",
      "got him, sir.\"\n",
      "\"No problems, were there?\"\n",
      "\"No, sir house was almost destroyed, but I got him out all right before\n",
      "the Muggles started swarmin' around. He fell asleep as we was flyin' over\n",
      "Bristol.\"\n",
      "Dumbledore and Professor McGonagall bent forward over the bundle of\n",
      "blankets. Inside, just visible, was a baby boy, fast asleep. Under a tuft of jet-\n",
      "black hair over his forehead they could see a curiously shaped cut, like a bolt of\n",
      "lightning.\n",
      "\"Is that where?\" whispered Professor McGonagall.\n",
      "\"Yes,\" said Dumbledore. “He'll have that scar forever.\"\n",
      "\"Couldn't you do something about it, Dumbledore?\"\n",
      "\"Even if I could, I wouldn't. Scars can come in handy. I have one myself\n",
      "above my left knee that is a perfect map of the London Underground. Well-\n",

      "great, shaggy head over Harry and gave him what must have been a very\n",
      "scratchy, whiskery kiss. Then, suddenly, Hagrid let out a howl like a wounded\n",
      "dog.\n",
      "\"Shhh!\" hissed Professor McGonagall, \"You'll wake the Muggles!\"\n",
      "\"S-s-sorry,\" sobbed Hagrid, taking out a large, spotted handkerchief and\n",

      "an' poor\n",

      "Dumbledore stepped over the low garden wall and walked to the front door. He\n",
      "laid Harry gently on the doorstep, took a letter out of his cloak, tucked it inside\n",
      "Harry's blankets, and then came back to the other two. For a full minute the\n",
      "three of them stood and looked at the little bundle; Hagrid's shoulders shook,\n",
      "Professor McGonagall blinked furiously, and the twinkling light that usually\n",
      "shone from Dumbledore's eyes seemed to have gone out.\n",
      "\"Well,\" said Dumbledore finally, \"that's that. We've no business staying\n",
      "here. We may as well go and join the celebrations.\"\n",
      "“Yeah,” said Hagrid in a very muffled voice, “I'll be takin' Sirius his bike\n",
      "back. G'night, Professor McGonagall - Professor Dumbledore, sir.\"\n",
      "Wiping his streaming eyes on his jacket sleeve, Hagrid swung himself\n",
      "onto the motorcycle and kicked the engine into life; with a roar it rose into the\n",
      "air and off into the night.\n",
      "\"I shall see you soon, I expect, Professor McGonagall,\" said\n",
      "Dumbledore, nodding to her. Professor McGonagall blew her nose in reply.\n",
      "Dumbledore turned and walked back down the street. On the corner he\n",
      "stopped and took out the silver Put-Outer. He clicked it once, and twelve balls of\n",
      "light sped back to their street lamps so that Privet Drive glowed suddenly orange\n",
      "and he could make out a tabby cat slinking around the corner at the other end of\n",
      "the street. He could just see the bundle of blankets on the step of number four.\n",
      "\"Good luck, Harry,\" he murmured. He turned on his heel and with a\n",

      "held together with a lot of Scotch tape because of all the times Dudley had\n",
      "punched him on the nose. The only thing Harry liked about his own appearance\n",
      "was a very thin scar on his forehead that was shaped like a bolt of lightning. He\n",

      "simply grew that way - all over the place.\n",
      "Harry was frying eggs by the time Dudley arrived in the kitchen with his\n",

      "there wasn't much room. Dudley, meanwhile, was counting his presents. His\n",

      "under this big one from Mummy and Daddy.\"\n",
      "\"All right, thirty-seven then,\" said Dudley, going red in the face. Harry,\n",
      "who could see a huge Dudley tantrum coming on, began wolfing down his bacon\n",
      "as fast as possible in case Dudley turned the table over.\n",
      "Aunt Petunia obviously scented danger, too, because she said quickly,\n",
      "\"And we'll buy you another two presents while we're out today. How's that,\n",
      "popkin? Two more presents. Is that all right\"\n",

      "\"\"\n",
      "\"Thirty-nine, sweetums,\" said Aunt Petunia.\n",
      "\"Oh.\" Dudley sat down heavily and grabbed the nearest parcel. \"All right\n",

      "\"Little tyke wants his money's worth, just like his father. 'Atta boy,\n",
      "Dudley!\" He ruffled Dudley's hair.\n",
      "then.\"\n",
      "At that moment the telephone rang and Aunt Petunia went to answer it\n",
      "while Harry and Uncle Vernon watched Dudley unwrap the racing bike, a video\n",

      "look at photographs of all the cats she'd ever owned.\n",
      "\"Now what?\" said Aunt Petunia, looking furiously at Harry as though\n",
      "he’d planned this. Harry knew he ought to feel sorry that Mrs. Figg had broken\n",

      "you'd expect to be involved in anything strange or mysterious, because they just\n",
      "didn't hold with such nonsense.\n",
      "Mr. Dursley was the director of a firm called Grunnings, which made\n",
      "drills. He was a big, beefy man with hardly any neck, although he did have a\n",
      "very large mustache. Mrs. Dursley was thin and blonde and had nearly twice the\n",
      "usual amount of neck, which came in very useful as she spent so much of her\n",
      "time craning over garden fences, spying on the neighbors. The Dursleys had a\n",
      "small son called Dudley and in their opinion there was no finer boy anywhere.\n",
      "The Dursleys had everything they wanted, but they also had a secret, and\n",
      "their greatest fear was that somebody would discover it. They didn't think they\n",

      "to think what the neighbors would say if the Potters arrived in the street. The\n",
      "Dursleys knew that the Potters had a small son, too, but they had never even\n",
      "seen him. This boy was another good reason for keeping the Potters away; they\n",
      "didn't want Dudley mixing with a child like that.\n",
      "When Mr. and Mrs. Dursley woke up on the dull, gray Tuesday our story\n",
      "starts, there was nothing about the cloudy sky outside to suggest that strange and\n",
      "mysterious things would soon be happening all over the country. Mr. Dursley\n",
      "hummed as he picked out his most boring tie for work, and Mrs. Dursley\n",
      "gossiped away happily as she wrestled a screaming Dudley into his high chair.\n",
      "None of them noticed a large, tawny owl flutter past the window.\n",
      "At half past eight, Mr. Dursley picked up his briefcase, pecked Mrs.\n",

      "sight. What could he have been thinking of? It must have been a trick of the\n",
      "light. Mr. Dursley blinked and stared at the cat. It stared back. As Mr. Dursley\n",
      "drove around the corner and up the road, he watched the cat in his mirror. It was\n",
      "now reading the sign that said Privet Drive - no, looking at the sign; cats\n",
      "couldn't read maps or signs. Mr. Dursley gave himself a little shake and put the\n",
      "cat out of his mind. As he drove toward town he thought of nothing except a\n",
      "large order of drills he was hoping to get that day.\n",
      "But on the edge of town, drills were driven out of his mind by something\n",
      "else. As he sat in the usual morning traffic jam, he couldn't help noticing that\n",
      "there seemed to be a lot of strangely dressed people about. People in cloaks. Mr.\n",
      "Dursley couldn't bear people who dressed in funny clothes the getups you\n",
      "saw on young people! He supposed this was some stupid new fashion. He\n",
      "drummed his fingers on the steering wheel and his eyes fell on a huddle of these\n",
      "weirdos standing quite close by. They were whispering excitedly together. Mr.\n",
      "Dursley was enraged to see that a couple of them weren't young at all; why, that\n",
      "man had to be older than he was, and wearing an emerald-green cloak! The\n",
      "nerve of him! But then it struck Mr. Dursley that this was probably some silly\n",
      "stunt these people were obviously collecting for something...yes, that would\n",
      "be it. The traffic moved on and a few minutes later, Mr. Dursley arrived in the\n",
      "Grunnings parking lot, his mind back on drills.\n",
      "Mr. Dursley always sat with his back to the window in his office on the\n",
      "ninth floor. If he hadn't, he might have found it harder to concentrate on drills\n",
      "that morning. He didn't see the owls swooping past in broad daylight, though\n",
      "people down in the street did; they pointed and gazed open-mouthed as owl after\n",
      "owl sped overhead. Most of them had never seen an owl even at nighttime. Mr.\n",
      "Dursley, however, had a perfectly normal, owl-free morning. He yelled at five\n",
      "different people. He made several important telephone calls and shouted a bit\n",
      "more. He was in a very good mood until lunchtime, when he thought he'd stretch\n",
      "his legs and walk across the road to buy himself a bun from the bakery.\n",
      "He'd for gotten all about the people in cloaks until he passed a group of\n",
      "them next to the baker's. He eyed them angrily as he passed. He didn't know\n",
      "why, but they made him uneasy. This bunch were whispering excitedly, too, and\n",
      "he couldn't see a single collecting tin. It was on his way back past them,\n",
      "clutching a large doughnut in a bag, that he caught a few words of what they\n",
      "were saying.\n",
      "\"The Potters, that's right, that's what I heard\n",
      "\"\"\n",
      "66\n",
      "99\n",
      "yes, their son, Harry -\n",
      "Mr. Dursley stopped dead. Fear flooded him. He looked back at the\n",
      "whisperers as if he wanted to say something to them, but thought better of it.\n",
      "He dashed back across the road, hurried up to his office, snapped at his\n",
      "secretary not to disturb him, seized his telephone, and had almost finished\n",
      "dialing his home number when he changed his mind. He put the receiver back\n",
      "down and stroked his mustache, thinking...no, he was being stupid. Potter\n",
      "wasn't such an unusual name. He was sure there were lots of people called Potter\n",
      "who had a son called Harry. Come to think of it, he wasn't even sure his nephew\n",
      "was called Harry. He'd never even seen the boy. It might have been Harvey. Or\n",
      "Harold. There was no point in worrying Mrs. Dursley; she always got so upset at\n",
      "any mention of her sister. He didn't blame her - if he'd had a sister like that…..\n",
      "but all the same, those people in cloaks…...\n",
      "He found it a lot harder to concentrate on drills that afternoon and when\n",
      "he left the building at five o'clock, he was still so worried that he walked straight\n",
      "into someone just outside the door.\n",
      "\"Sorry,\" he grunted, as the tiny old man stumbled and almost fell. It was\n",
      "a few seconds before Mr. Dursley realized that the man was wearing a violet\n",
      "cloak. He didn't seem at all upset at being almost knocked to the ground. On the\n",
      "contrary, his face split into a wide smile and he said in a squeaky voice that made\n",
      "passersby stare, \"Don't be sorry, my dear sir, for nothing could upset me today!\n",
      "Rejoice, for You-Know-Who has gone at last! Even Muggles like yourself\n",
      "should be celebrating, this happy, happy day!\"\n",
      "And the old man hugged Mr. Dursley around the middle and walked off.\n",
      "Mr. Dursley stood rooted to the spot. He had been hugged by a complete\n",
      "stranger. He also thought he had been called a Muggle, whatever that was. He\n",
      "was rattled. He hurried to his car and set off for home, hoping he was imagining\n",
      "things, which he had never hoped before, because he didn't approve of\n",
      "imagination.\n",
      "As he pulled into the driveway of number four, the first thing he saw\n",
      "and it didn't improve his mood - was the tabby cat he'd spotted that morning. It\n",
      "was now sitting on his garden wall. He was sure it was the same one; it had the\n",
      "same markings around its eyes.\n",
      "\"Shoo!\" said Mr. Dursley loudly.\n",
      "The cat didn't move. It just gave him a stern look. Was this normal cat\n",
      "behavior? Mr. Dursley wondered. Trying to pull himself together, he let himself\n",
      "into the house. He was still determined not to mention anything to his wife.\n",
      "Mrs. Dursley had had a nice, normal day. She told him over dinner all\n",
      "about Mrs. Next Door's problems with her daughter and how Dudley had\n",
      "learned a new word (\"Won't!\"). Mr. Dursley tried to act normally. When Dudley\n",
      "had been put to bed, he went into the living room in time to catch the last report\n",
      "on the evening news:\n",
      "\"And finally, bird-watchers everywhere have reported that the nation's\n",
      "owls have been behaving very unusually today. Although owls normally hunt at\n",
      "night and are hardly ever seen in daylight, there have been hundreds of sightings\n",
      "of these birds flying in every direction since sunrise. Experts are unable to\n",
      "explain why the owls have suddenly changed their sleeping pattern.\" The\n",
      "newscaster allowed himself a grin. “Most mysterious. And now, over to Jim\n",
      "McGuffin with the weather. Going to be any more showers of owls tonight,\n",
      "Jim?\"\n",
      "\"Well, Ted,\" said the weatherman, “I don't know about that, but it's not\n",
      "only the owls that have been acting oddly today. Viewers as far apart as Kent,\n",
      "Yorkshire, and Dundee have been phoning in to tell me that instead of the rain I\n",
      "promised yesterday, they've had a downpour of shooting stars! Perhaps people\n",
      "have been celebrating Bonfire Night early it's not until next week, folks! But\n",
      "I can promise a wet night tonight.\"\n",
      "Mr. Dursley sat frozen in his armchair. Shooting stars all over Britain?\n",
      "Owls flying by daylight? Mysterious people in cloaks all over the place? And a\n",
      "whisper, a whisper about the Potters....\n",
      "Mrs. Dursley came into the living room carrying two cups of tea. It was\n",
      "no good. He'd have to say something to her. He cleared his throat nervously. \"Er\n",
      "Petunia, dear you haven't heard from your sister lately, have you?\"\n",
      "As he had expected, Mrs. Dursley looked shocked and angry. After all,\n",
      "they normally pretended she didn't have a sister.\n",
      "\"No,\" she said sharply. \"Why?\"\n",
      "\"Funny stuff on the news,\" Mr. Dursley mumbled. \"Owls...shooting\n",
      "stars...and there were a lot of funny-looking people in town today....\"\n",
      "\"So?\" snapped Mrs. Dursley.\n",
      "\"Well, I just thought...maybe...it was something to do with...you\n",
      "know...her crowd.\"\n",
      "Mrs. Dursley sipped her tea through pursed lips. Mr. Dursley wondered\n",
      "whether he dared tell her he'd heard the name \"Potter.\" He decided he didn't\n",
      "dare. Instead he said, as casually as he could, “Their son he'd be about\n",
      "Dudley's age now, wouldn't he?\"\n",
      "\"I suppose so,\" said Mrs. Dursley stiffly.\n",
      "\"What's his name again? Howard, isn't it?\"\n",
      "\"Harry. Nasty, common name, if you ask me.\"\n",
      "\"Oh, yes,\" said Mr. Dursley, his heart sinking horribly. “Yes, I quite\n",
      "agree.\"\n",
      "He didn't say another word on the subject as they went upstairs to bed.\n",
      "While Mrs. Dursley was in the bathroom, Mr. Dursley crept to the bedroom\n",
      "window and peered down into the front garden. The cat was still there. It was\n",
      "staring down Privet Drive as though it were waiting for something.\n",
      "Was he imagining things? Could all this have anything to do with the\n",
      "Potters? If it did...if it got out that they were related to a pair of — well, he didn't\n",
      "think he could bear it.\n",
      "The Dursleys got into bed. Mrs. Dursley fell asleep quickly but Mr.\n",
      "Dursley lay awake, turning it all over in his mind. His last, comforting thought\n",
      "before he fell asleep was that even if the Potters were involved, there was no\n",
      "reason for them to come near him and Mrs. Dursley. The Potters knew very well\n",
      "what he and Petunia thought about them and their kind....He couldn't see how he\n",
      "and Petunia could get mixed up in anything that might be going on he\n",
      "yawned and turned over - it couldn't affect them....\n",
      "How very wrong he was.\n",
      "Mr. Dursley might have been drifting into an uneasy sleep, but the cat on\n",
      "the wall outside was showing no sign of sleepiness. It was sitting as still as a\n",
      "statue, its eyes fixed unblinkingly on the far corner of Privet Drive. It didn't so\n",
      "much as quiver when a car door slammed on the next street, nor when two owls\n",
      "swooped overhead. In fact, it was nearly midnight before the cat moved at all.\n",
      "A man appeared on the corner the cat had been watching, appeared so\n",
      "suddenly and silently you'd have thought he'd just popped out of the ground.\n",
      "The cat's tail twitched and its eyes narrowed.\n",
      "Nothing like this man had ever been seen on Privet Drive. He was tall,\n",
      "thin, and very old, judging by the silver of his hair and beard, which were both\n",
      "long enough to tuck into his belt. He was wearing long robes, a purple cloak that\n",
      "swept the ground, and high-heeled, buckled boots. His blue eyes were light,\n",
      "bright, and sparkling behind half-moon spectacles and his nose was very long\n",
      "and crooked, as though it had been broken at least twice. This man's name was\n",
      "Albus Dumbledore.\n",
      "Albus Dumbledore didn't seem to realize that he had just arrived in a\n",
      "street where everything from his name to his boots was unwelcome. He was\n",
      "busy rummaging in his cloak, looking for something. But he did seem to realize\n",
      "he was being watched, because he looked up suddenly at the cat, which was still\n",
      "staring at him from the other end of the street. For some reason, the sight of the\n",
      "cat seemed to amuse him. He chuckled and muttered, “I should have known.\"\n",
      "He found what he was looking for in his inside pocket. It seemed to be a\n",
      "silver cigarette lighter. He flicked it open, held it up in the air, and clicked it. The\n",
      "the next\n",
      "nearest street lamp went out with a little pop. He clicked it again\n",
      "lamp flickered into darkness. Twelve times he clicked the Put-Outer, until the\n",
      "only lights left on the whole street were two tiny pinpricks in the distance, which\n",
      "were the eyes of the cat watching him. If anyone looked out of their window\n",
      "now, even beady-eyed Mrs. Dursley, they wouldn't be able to see anything that\n",
      "was happening down on the pavement. Dumbledore slipped the Put-Outer back\n",
      "inside his cloak and set off down the street toward number four, where he sat\n",
      "down on the wall next to the cat. He didn't look at it, but after a moment he\n",
      "spoke to it.\n",
      "\"Fancy seeing you here, Professor McGonagall.\"\n",
      "He turned to smile at the tabby, but it had gone. Instead he was smiling at\n",
      "a rather severe-looking woman who was wearing square glasses exactly the\n",
      "shape of the markings the cat had had around its eyes. She, too, was wearing a\n",
      "cloak, an emerald one. Her black hair was drawn into a tight bun. She looked\n",
      "distinctly ruffled.\n",
      "\"How did you know it was me?\" she asked.\n",
      "\"My dear Professor, I've never seen a cat sit so stiffly.\"\n",
      "\"You'd be stiff if you'd been sitting on a brick wall all day,\" said\n",
      "Professor McGonagall.\n",
      "\"All day? When you could have been celebrating? I must have passed a\n",
      "dozen feasts and parties on my way here.\"\n",
      "Professor McGonagall sniffed angrily.\n",
      "\"Oh yes, I've celebrating, all right,\" she said impatiently. \"You'd think\n",
      "they'd be a bit more careful, but no -even the Muggles have noticed\n",
      "something's going on. It was on their news.\" She jerked her head back at the\n",
      "Dursleys' dark living-room window. \"I heard it. Flocks of owls...shooting\n",
      "stars...Well, they're not completely stupid. They were bound to notice\n",
      "something. Shooting stars down in Kent - I'll bet that was Dedalus Diggle. He\n",
      "never had much sense.\"\n",
      "\"You can't blame them,\" said Dumbledore gently. \"We've had precious\n",
      "little to celebrate for eleven years.\"\n",
      "\"I know that,\" said Professor McGonagall irritably. “But that's no reason\n",
      "to lose our heads. People are being downright careless, out on the streets in\n",
      "broad daylight, not even dressed in Muggle clothes, swapping rumors.\"\n",
      "She threw a sharp, sideways glance at Dumbledore here, as though\n",
      "hoping he was going to tell her something, but he didn't, so she went on. \"A fine\n",

      "trying to make the players move.\n",
      "Neville had never been on a broomstick in his life, because his\n",

      "A barn owl brought Neville a small package from his grandmother. He\n",

      "to fight Malfoy, but Professor McGonagall, who could spot trouble quicker than\n",

      "\"Malfoy's got my Remembrall, Professor.\"\n",
      "Scowling, Malfoy quickly dropped the Remembrall back on the table.\n",
      "\"Just looking,\" he said, and he sloped away with Crabbe and Goyle\n",
      "behind him.\n",
      "At three-thirty that afternoon, Harry, Ron, and the other Gryffindors hurried\n",
      "down the front steps onto the grounds for their first flying lesson. It was a clear,\n",
      "breezy day, and the grass rippled under their feet as they marched down the\n",
      "sloping lawns toward a smooth, flat lawn on the opposite side of the grounds to\n",
      "the forbidden forest, whose trees were swaying darkly in the distance.\n",
      "The Slytherins were already there, and so were twenty broomsticks lying\n",
      "in neat lines on the ground. Harry had heard Fred and George Weasley complain\n",
      "about the school brooms, saying that some of them started to vibrate if you flew\n",
      "too high, or always flew slightly to the left.\n",
      "Their teacher, Madam Hooch, arrived. She had short, gray hair, and\n",
      "yellow eyes like a hawk.\n",
      "\"Well, what are you all waiting for?\" she barked. \"Everyone stand by a\n",
      "broomstick. Come on, hurry up.\"\n",
      "Harry glanced down at his broom. It was old and some of the twigs stuck\n",
      "out at odd angles.\n",
      "\"Stick out your right hand over your broom,\" called Madam Hooch at the\n",

      "\"UP\" everyone shouted.\n",
      "Harry's broom jumped into his hand at once, but it was one of the few\n",
      "that did. Hermione Granger's had simply rolled over on the ground, and\n",
      "Neville's hadn't moved at all. Perhaps brooms, like horses, could tell when you\n",
      "were afraid, thought Harry; there was a quaver in Neville's voice that said only\n",
      "too clearly that he wanted to keep his feet on the ground.\n",
      "Madam Hooch then showed them how to mount their brooms without\n",
      "sliding off the end, and walked up and down the rows correcting their grips.\n",
      "Harry and Ron were delighted when she told Malfoy he'd been doing it wrong\n",
      "for years.\n",
      "\"Now, when I blow my whistle, you kick off from the ground, hard,” said\n",

      "straight back down by leaning forward slightly. On my whistle three two\n",
      "But Neville, nervous and jumpy and frightened of being left on the\n",
      "ground, pushed off hard before the whistle had touched Madam Hooch's lips.\n",
      "\"Come back, boy!\" she shouted, but Neville was rising straight up like a\n",
      "cork shot out of a bottle twelve feet\n",
      "twenty feet. Harry saw his scared\n",
      "white face look down at the ground falling away, saw him gasp, slip sideways\n",
      "off the broom and\n",
      "WHAM a thud and a nasty crack and Neville lay facedown on the\n",
      "grass in a heap. His broomstick was still rising higher and higher, and started to\n",
      "drift lazily toward the forbidden forest and out of sight.\n",
      "Madam Hooch was bending over Neville, her face as white as his.\n",
      "\"Broken wrist,\" Harry heard her mutter. “Come on, boy — it's all right,\n",
      "up you get.\"\n",
      "She turned to the rest of the class.\n",
      "\"None of you is to move while I take this boy to the hospital wing! You\n",
      "leave those brooms where they are or you'll be out of Hogwarts before you can\n",
      "say 'Quidditch.' Come on, dear.\"\n",
      "Neville, his face tear-streaked, clutching his wrist, hobbled off with\n",
      "Madam Hooch, who had her arm around him.\n",
      "No sooner were they out of earshot than Malfoy burst into laughter.\n",
      "\"Did you see his face, the great lump?\"\n",
      "The other Slytherins joined in.\n",
      "\"Shut up, Malfoy,\" snapped Parvati Patil.\n",
      "\"Ooh, sticking up for Longbottom?\" said Pansy Parkinson, a hard-faced\n",
      "Slytherin girl. \"Never thought you'd like fat little crybabies, Parvati.\"\n",
      "\"Look!\" said Malfoy, darting forward and snatching something out of the\n",
      "grass. \"It's that stupid thing Longbottom's gran sent him.\"\n",
      "watch.\n",
      "The Remembrall glittered in the sun as he held it up.\n",
      "\"Give that here, Malfoy,\" said Harry quietly. Everyone stopped talking to\n",
      "Malfoy smiled nastily.\n",
      "\"I think I'll leave it somewhere for Longbottom to find — how about\n",
      "up a tree?\"\n",
      "\"Give it here!\" Harry yelled, but Malfoy had leapt onto his broomstick\n",
      "and taken off. He hadn't been lying, he could fly well. Hovering level with the\n",
      "topmost branches of an oak he called, “Come and get it, Potter!\"\n",
      "Harry grabbed his broom.\n",
      "\"No!\" shouted Hermione Granger. “Madam Hooch told us not to move\n",
      "- you'll get us all into trouble.\"\n",
      "Harry ignored her. Blood was pounding in his ears. He mounted the\n",
      "broom and kicked hard against the ground and up, up he soared; air rushed\n",
      "through his hair, and his robes whipped out behind him — and in a rush of fierce\n",
      "joy he realized he'd found something he could do without being taught — this\n",
      "was easy, this was wonderful. He pulled his broomstick up a little to take it even\n",
      "higher, and heard screams and gasps of girls back on the ground and an admiring\n",
      "whoop from Ron.\n",
      "He turned his broomstick sharply to face Malfoy in midair. Malfoy\n",
      "looked stunned.\n",
      "\"Give it here,\" Harry called, “or I'll knock you off that broom!\"\n",
      "\"Oh, yeah?\" said Malfoy, trying to sneer, but looking worried.\n",
      "Harry knew, somehow, what to do. He leaned forward and grasped the\n",
      "broom tightly in both hands, and it shot toward Malfoy like a javelin. Malfoy\n",
      "only just got out of the way in time; Harry made a sharp about-face and held the\n",
      "broom steady. A few people below were clapping.\n",
      "\"No Crabbe and Goyle up here to save your neck, Malfoy,\" Harry called.\n",
      "The same thought seemed to have struck Malfoy.\n",
      "\"Catch it if you can, then!\" he shouted, and he threw the glass ball high\n",
      "into the air and streaked back toward the ground.\n",
      "next\n",
      "Harry saw, as though in slow motion, the ball rise up in the air and then\n",
      "start to fall. He leaned forward and pointed his broom handle down\n",
      "second he was gathering speed in a steep dive, racing the ball\n",
      "in his ears, mingled with the screams of people watching - he stretched out his\n",
      "wind whistled\n",
      "hand a foot from the ground he caught it, just in time to pull his broom\n",
      "straight, and he toppled gently onto the grass with the Remembrall clutched\n",
      "safely in his fist.\n",
      "\"HARRY POTTER!\"\n",
      "His heart sank faster than he'd just dived. Professor McGonagall was\n",
      "running toward them. He got to his feet, trembling.\n",
      "\"Never\n",
      "\"9\n",
      "in all my time at Hogwarts —\n",
      "Professor McGonagall was almost speechless with shock, and her glasses\n",
      "flashed furiously, how dare you — might have broken your neck —”\n",
      "\"It wasn't his fault, Professor —\"\n",
      "\"Be quiet, Miss Patil —”\n",
      "\"But Malfoy -”\n",
      "\"That's enough, Mr. Weasley. Potter, follow me, now.\"\n",
      "Harry caught sight of Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle's triumphant faces as\n",
      "he left, walking numbly in Professor McGonagall's wake as she strode toward\n",
      "the castle. He was going to be expelled, he just knew it. He wanted to say\n",
      "something to defend himself, but there seemed to be something wrong with his\n",
      "voice. Professor McGonagall was sweeping along without even looking at him;\n",
      "he had to jog to keep up. Now he'd done it. He hadn't even lasted two weeks.\n",
      "He'd be packing his bags in ten minutes. What would the Dursleys say when he\n",
      "turned up on the doorstep?\n",
      "Up the front steps, up the marble staircase inside, and still Professor\n",
      "McGonagall didn't say a word to him. She wrenched open doors and marched\n",
      "along corridors with Harry trotting miserably behind her. Maybe she was taking\n",
      "him to Dumbledore. He thought of Hagrid, expelled but allowed to stay on as\n",
      "gamekeeper. Perhaps he could be Hagrid's assistant. His stomach twisted as he\n",
      "imagined it, watching Ron and the others becoming wizards, while he stumped\n",
      "around the grounds carrying Hagrid's bag.\n",
      "Professor McGonagall stopped outside a classroom. She opened the door\n",
      "and poked her head inside.\n",
      "\"Excuse me, Professor Flitwick, could I borrow Wood for a moment?\"\n",
      "Wood? thought Harry, bewildered; was Wood a cane she was going to\n",
      "use on him?\n",
      "But Wood turned out to be a person, a burly fifth-year boy who came out\n",
      "of Flitwick's class looking confused.\n",
      "\"Follow me, you two,\" said Professor McGonagall, and they marched on\n",
      "up the corridor, Wood looking curiously at Harry.\n",
      "\"In here.\"\n",
      "Professor McGonagall pointed them into a classroom that was empty\n",
      "except for Peeves, who was busy writing rude words on the blackboard.\n",
      "\"Out, Peeves!\" she barked. Peeves threw the chalk into a bin, which\n",
      "clanged loudly, and he swooped out cursing. Professor McGonagall slammed the\n",
      "door behind him and turned to face the two boys.\n",
      "\"Potter, this is Oliver Wood. Wood - I've found you a Seeker.\"\n",
      "Wood's expression changed from puzzlement to delight.\n",
      "\"Are you serious, Professor?\"\n",
      "\"Absolutely,” said Professor McGonagall crisply. \"The boy's a natural.\n",
      "I've never seen anything like it. Was that your first time on a broomstick,\n",
      "Potter?\"\n",
      "Harry nodded silently. He didn't have a clue what was going on, but he\n",
      "didn't seem to be being expelled, and some of the feeling started coming back to\n",
      "his legs.\n",
      "\"He caught that thing in his hand after a fifty-foot dive,\" Professor\n",
      "McGonagall told Wood. \"Didn't even scratch himself. Charlie Weasley couldn't\n",
      "have done it.”\n",
      "Wood was now looking as though all his dreams had come true at once.\n",
      "\"Ever seen a game of Quidditch, Potter?” he asked excitedly.\n",
      "\"Wood's captain of the Gryffindor team,\" Professor McGonagall\n",
      "explained.\n",
      "\"He's just the build for a Seeker, too,” said Wood, now walking around\n",
      "Harry and staring at him. “Light -speedy we'll have to get him a decent\n",

      "\"I shall speak to Professor Dumbledore and see if we can't bend the first-\n",

      "last match by Slytherin, I couldn't look Severus Snape in the face for weeks....\"\n",
      "Professor McGonagall peered sternly over her glasses at Harry.\n",
      "\"I want to hear you're training hard, Potter, or I may change my mind\n",
      "about punishing you.\"\n",
      "Then she suddenly smiled.\n",

      "turned up: Malfoy, flanked by Crabbe and Goyle.\n",
      "“Having a last meal, Potter? When are you getting the train back to the\n",
      "Muggles?\"\n",
      "\"You're a lot braver now that you're back on the ground and you've got\n",

      "all little about Crabbe and Goyle, but as the High Table was full of teachers,\n",
      "neither of them could do more than crack their knuckles and scowl.\n",
      "\"I'd take you on anytime on my own,\" said Malfoy. \"Tonight, if you\n",
      "want. Wizard's duel. Wands only - no contact. What's the matter? Never heard\n",
      "of a wizard's duel before, I suppose?\"\n",

      "quickly, \"But people only die in proper duels, you know, with real wizards. The\n",

      "the points you'll lose Gryffindor if you're caught, and you're bound to be. It's\n",

      "can't remember how to block them.\" There was a very good chance they were\n",
      "going to get caught by Filch or Mrs. Norris, and Harry felt he was pushing his\n",
      "luck, breaking another school rule today. On the other hand, Malfoy's sneering\n",

      "\"Half-past eleven,\" Ron muttered at last, \"we'd better go.\"\n",
      "They pulled on their bathrobes, picked up their wands, and crept across\n",
      "the tower room, down the spiral staircase, and into the Gryffindor common\n",
      "room. A few embers were still glowing in the fireplace, turning all the armchairs\n",
      "into hunched black shadows. They had almost reached the portrait hole when a\n",

      "A lamp flickered on. It was Hermione Granger, wearing a pink bathrobe\n",

      "Harry couldn't believe anyone could be so interfering.\n",
      "\"Come on,\" he said to Ron. He pushed open the portrait of the Fat Lady\n",

      "Hermione wasn't going to give up that easily. She followed Ron through\n",
      "the portrait hole, hissing at them like an angry goose.\n",

      "don't want Slytherin to win the house cup, and you'll lose all the points I got\n",

      "But what they were, they didn't find out. Hermione had turned to the\n",
      "portrait of the Fat Lady to get back inside and found herself facing an empty\n",

      "out of Gryffindor tower.\n",
      "late.\"\n",
      "\"Now what am I going to do?\" she asked shrilly.\n",
      "\"That's your problem,” said Ron. “We've got to go, we're going to be\n",

      "up with them.\n",
      "\"I'm coming with you,\" she said.\n",
      "\"You are not.\"\n",

      "\"Mrs. Norris?\" breathed Ron, squinting through the dark.\n",
      "It wasn't Mrs. Norris. It was Neville. He was curled up on the floor, fast\n",
      "asleep, but jerked suddenly awake as they crept nearer.\n",
      "\"Thank goodness you found me! I've been out here for hours, I couldn't\n",

      "Neville.\n",

      "forward.\n",
      "They flitted along corridors striped with bars of moonlight from the high\n",
      "windows. At every turn Harry expected to run into Filch or Mrs. Norris, but they\n",
      "were lucky. They sped up a staircase to the third floor and tiptoed toward the\n",
      "trophy room.\n",
      "Malfoy and Crabbe weren't there yet. The crystal trophy cases\n",
      "glimmered where the moonlight caught them. Cups, shields, plates, and statues\n",
      "winked silver and gold in the darkness. They edged along the walls, keeping\n",
      "their eyes on the doors at either end of the room. Harry took out his wand in case\n",
      "Malfoy leapt in and started at once. The minutes crept by.\n",
      "\"He's late, maybe he's chickened out,\" Ron whispered.\n",
      "Then a noise in the next room made them jump. Harry had only just\n",
      "raised his wand when they heard someone speak - and it wasn't Malfoy.\n",
      "\"Sniff around, my sweet, they might be lurking in a corner.”\n",
      "It was Filch speaking to Mrs. Norris. Horror-struck, Harry waved madly\n",
      "at the other three to follow him as quickly as possible; they scurried silently\n",
      "toward the door, away from Filch's voice. Neville's robes had barely whipped\n",
      "round the corner when they heard Filch enter the trophy room.\n",
      "\"They're in here somewhere,\" they heard him mutter, \"probably hiding.\"\n",
      "\"This way!\" Harry mouthed to the others and, petrified, they began to\n",
      "creep down a long gallery full of suits of armor. They could hear Filch getting\n",
      "nearer. Neville suddenly let out a frightened squeak and broke into a run he\n",
      "tripped, grabbed Ron around the waist, and the pair of them toppled right into a\n",
      "suit of armor.\n",
      "The clanging and crashing were enough to wake the whole castle.\n",
      "\"RUN!\" Harry yelled, and the four of them sprinted down the gallery, not\n",
      "looking back to see whether Filch was following they swung around the\n",
      "doorpost and galloped down one corridor then another, Harry in the lead, without\n",
      "any idea where they were or where they were going they ripped through a\n",
      "tapestry and found themselves in a hidden passageway, hurtled along it and came\n",
      "out near their Charms classroom, which they knew was miles from the trophy\n",
      "room.\n",
      "\"I think we've lost him,\" Harry panted, leaning against the cold wall and\n",
      "wiping his forehead. Neville was bent double, wheezing and spluttering.\n",
      "told you,\" Hermione gasped, clutching at the stitch in her chest,\n",
      "I\n",
      "\"I-told-you.\"\n",
      "\"We've got to get back to Gryffindor tower,\" said Ron, \"quickly as\n",
      "possible.\"\n",
      "\"Malfoy tricked you,\" Hermione said to Harry. \"You realize that, don't\n",
      "you? He was never going to meet you Filch knew someone was going to be in\n",
      "the trophy room, Malfoy must have tipped him off.\"\n",
      "Harry thought she was probably right, but he wasn't going to tell her that.\n",
      "\"Let's go.\"\n",
      "It wasn't going to be that simple. They hadn't gone more than a dozen\n",
      "paces when a doorknob rattled and something came shooting out of a classroom\n",
      "in front of them.\n",
      "It was Peeves. He caught sight of them and gave a squeal of delight.\n",
      "\"Shut up, Peeves — please you'll get us thrown out.\"\n",
      "Peeves cackled.\n",
      "\"Wandering around at midnight, Ickle Firsties? Tut, tut, tut. Naughty,\n",

      "\"Not if you don't give us away, Peeves, please.\"\n",
      "\"Should tell Filch, I should,\" said Peeves in a saintly voice, but his eyes\n",
      "glittered wickedly. \"It's for your own good, you know.\"\n",
      "\"Get out of the way,\" snapped Ron, taking a swipe at Peeves this was a\n",
      "big mistake.\n",
      "\"STUDENTS OUT OF BED!\" Peeves bellowed, \"STUDENTS OUT OF\n",
      "BED DOWN THE CHARMS CORRIDOR!\"\n",
      "Ducking under Peeves, they ran for their lives, right to the end of the\n",
      "corridor where they slammed into a door — and it was locked.\n",
      "\"This is it!\" Ron moaned, as they pushed helplessly at the door, \"We're\n",
      "done for! This is the end!\"\n",
      "They could hear footsteps, Filch running as fast as he could toward\n",
      "Peeves's shouts.\n",
      "\"Oh, move over,\" Hermione snarled. She grabbed Harry's wand, tapped\n",
      "the lock, and whispered, \"Alohomora!\"\n",
      "The lock clicked and the door swung open\n",
      "they piled through it, shut\n",
      "\"Which way did they go, Peeves?\" Filch was saying. \"Quick, tell me.\"\n",
      "\"Say 'please.\"\"\n",
      "\"Don't mess with me, Peeves, now where did they go?\"\n",
      "it quickly, and pressed their ears against it, listening.\n",
      "\"Shan't say nothing if you don't say please,” said Peeves in his annoying\n",
      "singsong voice.\n",
      "\"All right- please.'\n",
      "\"NOTHING! Ha haaa! Told you I wouldn't say nothing if you didn't say\n",
      "please! Ha ha! Haaaaaa!\" And they heard the sound of Peeves whooshing away\n",
      "and Filch cursing in rage.\n",
      "\"\"\n",
      "\"He thinks this door is locked,\" Harry whispered. \"I think we'll be okay\n",

      "bathrobe for the last minute. \"What?\"\n",
      "Harry turned around\n",
      "and saw, quite clearly, what. For a moment, he\n",
      "was sure he'd walked into a nightmare this was too much, on top of\n",
      "everything that had happened so far.\n",
      "They weren't in a room, as he had supposed. They were in a corridor.\n",
      "The forbidden corridor on the third floor. And now they knew why it was\n",
      "forbidden.\n",
      "They were looking straight into the eyes of a monstrous dog, a dog that\n",
      "filled the whole space between ceiling and floor. It had three heads. Three pairs\n",
      "of rolling, mad eyes; three noses, twitching and quivering in their direction; three\n",
      "drooling mouths, saliva hanging in slippery ropes from yellowish fangs.\n",
      "It was standing quite still, all six eyes staring at them, and Harry knew\n",
      "that the only reason they weren't already dead was that their sudden appearance\n",
      "had taken it by surprise, but it was quickly getting over that, there was no\n",
      "mistaking what those thunderous growls meant.\n",
      "Harry groped for the doorknob between Filch and death, he'd take\n",
      "Filch.\n",
      "—\n",
      "They fell backward - Harry slammed the door shut, and they ran, they\n",
      "almost flew, back down the corridor. Filch must have hurried off to look for\n",
      "them somewhere else, because they didn't see him anywhere, but they hardly\n",
      "cared all they wanted to do was put as much space as possible between them\n",
      "and that monster. They didn't stop running until they reached the portrait of the\n",
      "Fat Lady on the seventh floor.\n",
      "\"Where on earth have you all been?” she asked, looking at their\n",
      "bathrobes hanging off their shoulders and their flushed, sweaty faces.\n",
      "\"Never mind that — pig snout, pig snout,” panted Harry, and the portrait\n",
      "swung forward. They scrambled into the common room and collapsed,\n",
      "trembling, into armchairs.\n",
      "It was a while before any of them said anything. Neville, indeed, looked\n",
      "as if he'd never speak again.\n",
      "\"What do they think they're doing, keeping a thing like that locked up in\n",
      "a school?\" said Ron finally. \"If any dog needs exercise, that one does.\"\n",
      "Hermione had got both her breath and her bad temper back again. “You\n",
      "don't use your eyes, any of you, do you?\" she snapped. \"Didn't you see what it\n",
      "was standing on.\n",
      "\"The floor?\" Harry suggested. \"I wasn't looking at its feet, I was too\n",
      "busy with its heads.\"\n",
      "\"No, not the floor. It was standing on a trapdoor. It's obviously guarding\n",
      "something.\"\n",
      "She stood up, glaring at them.\n",
      "\"I hope you're pleased with yourselves. We could all have been killed\n",
      "or worse, expelled. Now, if you don't mind, I'm going to bed.\"\n",
      "Ron stared after her, his mouth open.\n",
      "“No, we don't mind,” he said. “You'd think we dragged her along,\n",
      "wouldn't you.\n",
      "But Hermione had given Harry something else to think about as he\n",
      "climbed back into bed. The dog was guarding something... What had Hagrid\n",
      "said? Gringotts was the safest place in the world for something you wanted to\n",
      "hide - except perhaps Hogwarts.\n",
      "It looked as though Harry had found out where the grubby little package\n",
      "from vault seven hundred and thirteen was.\n",
      "HP 1 - Harry Potter and the\n",
      "Sorcerer's Stone\n",
      "HALLOWEEN\n",
      "CHAPTER TEN\n",
      "M alfoy couldn't believe his eyes when he saw that Harry and Ron were still\n",
      "at Hogwarts the next day, looking tired but perfectly cheerful. Indeed, by the\n",
      "next morning Harry and Ron thought that meeting the three-headed dog had\n",
      "been an excellent adventure, and they were quite keen to have another one. In\n",
      "the meantime, Harry filled Ron in about the package that seemed to have been\n",
      "moved from Gringotts to Hogwarts, and they spent a lot of time wondering what\n",
      "could possibly need such heavy protection.\n",
      "\"It's either really valuable or really dangerous,” said Ron.\n",
      "\"Or both,\" said Harry.\n",
      "But as all they knew for sure about the mysterious object was that it was\n",
      "about two inches long, they didn't have much chance of guessing what it was\n",
      "without further clues.\n",
      "Neither Neville nor Hermione showed the slightest interest in what lay\n",
      "underneath the dog and the trapdoor. All Neville cared about was never going\n",
      "near the dog again.\n",
      "Hermione was now refusing to speak to Harry and Ron, but she was such\n",
      "a bossy know-it-all that they saw this as an added bonus. All they really wanted\n",
      "now was a way of getting back at Malfoy, and to their great delight, just such a\n",
      "thing arrived in the mail about a week later.\n",
      "As the owls flooded into the Great Hall as usual, everyone's attention\n",
      "was caught at once by a long, thin package carried by six large screech owls.\n",
      "Harry was just as interested as everyone else to see what was in this large parcel,\n",
      "and was amazed when the owls soared down and dropped it right in front of him,\n",
      "knocking his bacon to the floor. They had hardly fluttered out of the way when\n",
      "another owl dropped a letter on top of the parcel.\n",
      "Harry ripped open the letter first, which was lucky, because it said:\n",
      "DO NOT OPEN THE PARCEL AT THE TABLE.\n",
      "It contains your new Nimbus Two Thousand, but I don't want\n",
      "everybody knowing you've got a broomstick or they'll all want one. Oliver\n",
      "Wood will meet you tonight on the Quidditch field at seven o'clock for your first\n",
      "training session.\n",
      "Professor McGonagall\n",
      "Harry had difficulty hiding his glee as he handed the note to Ron to read.\n",
      "\"A Nimbus Two Thousand!\" Ron moaned enviously. “I've never even\n",
      "touched one.\"\n",
      "They left the hall quickly, wanting to unwrap the broomstick in private\n",
      "before their first class, but halfway across the entrance hall they found the way\n",
      "upstairs barred by Crabbe and Goyle. Malfoy seized the package from Harry and\n",
      "felt it.\n",
      "\"That's a broomstick,” he said, throwing it back to Harry with a mixture\n",
      "of jealousy and spite on his face. “You'll be in for it this time, Potter, first years\n",
      "aren't allowed them.\"\n",
      "Ron couldn't resist it.\n",
      "\"It's not any old broomstick,\" he said, “it's a Nimbus Two Thousand.\n",
      "What did you say you've got at home, Malfoy, a Comet Two Sixty?\" Ron\n",
      "grinned at Harry. \"Comets look flashy, but they're not in the same league as the\n",
      "Nimbus.\"\n",
      "\"What would you know about it, Weasley, you couldn't afford half the\n",
      "handle,\" Malfoy snapped back. \"I suppose you and your brothers have to save up\n",
      "twig by twig.\"\n",
      "Before Ron could answer, Professor Flitwick appeared at Malfoy's\n",
      "elbow.\n",
      "\"Not arguing, I hope, boys?\" he squeaked.\n",
      "\"Potter's been sent a broomstick, Professor,\" said Malfoy quickly.\n",
      "\"Yes, yes, that's right,\" said Professor Flitwick, beaming at Harry.\n",
      "\"Professor McGonagall told me all about the special circumstances, Potter. And\n",
      "what model is it?\"\n",
      "\"A Nimbus Two Thousand, it is,\" said Harry, fighting not to laugh at the\n",
      "look of horror on Malfoy's face. “And it's really thanks to Malfoy here that I've\n",
      "got it,\" he added.\n",
      "Harry and Ron headed upstairs, smothering their laughter at Malfoy's\n",
      "obvious rage and confusion.\n",

      "\"\"\n",
      "\"So I suppose you think that's a reward for breaking rules?” came an\n",

      "Hermione marched away with her nose in the air.\n",
      "Harry had a lot of trouble keeping his mind on his lessons that day. It\n",
      "kept wandering up to the dormitory where his new broomstick was lying under\n",
      "his bed, or straying off to the Quidditch field where he'd be learning to play that\n",
      "night. He bolted his dinner that evening without noticing what he was eating,\n",
      "and then rushed upstairs with Ron to unwrap the Nimbus Two Thousand at last.\n",
      "\"Wow,\" Ron sighed, as the broomstick rolled onto Harry's bedspread.\n",
      "Even Harry, who knew nothing about the different brooms, thought it\n",
      "looked wonderful. Sleek and shiny, with a mahogany handle, it had a long tail of\n",
      "neat, straight twigs and Nimbus Two Thousand written in gold near the top.\n",
      "As seven o'clock drew nearer, Harry left the castle and set off in the dusk\n",
      "toward the Quidditch field. Held never been inside the stadium before. Hundreds\n",
      "of seats were raised in stands around the field so that the spectators were high\n",
      "enough to see what was going on. At either end of the field were three golden\n",
      "poles with hoops on the end. They reminded Harry of the little plastic sticks\n",
      "Muggle children blew bubbles through, except that they were fifty feet high.\n",
      "Too eager to fly again to wait for Wood, Harry mounted his broomstick\n",
      "and kicked off from the ground. What a feeling - he swooped in and out of the\n",
      "goal posts and then sped up and down the field. The Nimbus Two Thousand\n",
      "turned wherever he wanted at his lightest touch.\n",
      "\"Hey, Potter, come down!\"\n",
      "Oliver Wood had arrived. He was carrying a large wooden crate under his\n",
      "arm. Harry landed next to him.\n",
      "\"Very nice,\" said Wood, his eyes glinting. \"I see what McGonagall\n",
      "meant...you really are a natural. I'm just going to teach you the rules this\n",
      "evening, then you'll be joining team practice three times a week.\"\n",
      "He opened the crate. Inside were four different-sized balls.\n",
      "\"Right,\" said Wood. \"Now, Quidditch is easy enough to understand, even\n",
      "if it's not too easy to play. There are seven players on each side. Three of them\n",
      "are called Chasers.”\n",
      "\"Three Chasers,\" Harry repeated, as Wood took out a bright red ball\n",
      "about the size of a soccer ball.\n",
      "\"This ball's called the Quaffle,\" said Wood. \"The Chasers throw the\n",
      "Quaffle to each other and try and get it through one of the hoops to score a goal.\n",
      "Ten points every time the Quaffle goes through one of the hoops. Follow me?\"\n",
      "\"The Chasers throw the Quaffle and put it through the hoops to score,”\n",
      "Harry recited. \"So that's sort of like basketball on broomsticks with six\n",
      "hoops, isn't it?\"\n",
      "\"What's basketball?\" said Wood curiously.\n",
      "\"Never mind,\" said Harry quickly.\n",
      "\"Now, there's another player on each side who's called the Keeper - I'm\n",
      "Keeper for Gryffindor. I have to fly around our hoops and stop the other team\n",
      "from scoring.\"\n",
      "\"Three Chasers, one Keeper,\" said Harry, who was determined to\n",
      "remember it all. \"And they play with the Quaffle. Okay, got that. So what are\n",
      "they for?\" He pointed at the three balls left inside the box.\n",
      "\"I'll show you now,\" said Wood. \"Take this.\"\n",
      "He handed Harry a small club, a bit like a short baseball bat.\n",
      "\"I'm going to show you what the Bludgers do,” Wood said. “These two\n",
      "are the Bludgers.\"\n",
      "He showed Harry two identical balls, jet black and slightly smaller than\n",
      "the red Quaffle. Harry noticed that they seemed to be straining to escape the\n",
      "straps holding them inside the box.\n",
      "\"Stand back,\" Wood warned Harry. He bent down and freed one of the\n",
      "Bludgers.\n",
      "At once, the black ball rose high in the air and then pelted straight at\n",
      "Harry's face. Harry swung at it with the bat to stop it from breaking his nose, and\n",
      "sent it zigzagging away into the air — it zoomed around their heads and then\n",
      "shot at Wood, who dived on top of it and managed to pin it to the ground.\n",
      "\"See?\" Wood panted, forcing the struggling Bludger back into the crate\n",
      "and strapping it down safely. \"The Bludgers rocket around, trying to knock\n",
      "players off their brooms. That's why you have two Beaters on each team the\n",
      "Weasley twins are ours it's their job to protect their side from the Bludgers\n",
      "and try and knock them toward the other team. So - think you've got all that?\"\n",
      "\"Three Chasers try and score with the Quaffle; the Keeper guards the\n",
      "goal posts; the Beaters keep the Bludgers away from their team,” Harry reeled\n",
      "off.\n",
      "\"Very good,\" said Wood.\n",
      "\"Er have the Bludgers ever killed anyone?\" Harry asked, hoping he\n",
      "sounded offhand.\n",
      "\"Never at Hogwarts. We've had a couple of broken jaws but nothing\n",
      "worse than that. Now, the last member of the team is the Seeker. That's you. And\n",
      "you don't have to worry about the Quaffle or the Bludgers —\n",
      "unless they crack my head open.\"\n",
      "-\n",
      "\"Don't worry, the Weasleys are more than a match for the Bludgers - I\n",
      "mean, they're like a pair of human Bludgers themselves.\"\n",
      "Wood reached into the crate and took out the fourth and last ball.\n",
      "Compared with the Quaffle and the Bludgers, it was tiny, about the size of a\n",
      "large walnut. It was bright gold and had little fluttering silver wings.\n",
      "\"This,\" said Wood, \"is the Golden Snitch, and it's the most important ball\n",
      "of the lot. It's very hard to catch because it's so fast and difficult to see. It's the\n",
      "Seeker's job to catch it. You've got to weave in and out of the Chasers, Beaters,\n",
      "Bludgers, and Quaffle to get it before the other team's Seeker, because\n",
      "whichever Seeker catches the Snitch wins his team an extra hundred and fifty\n",
      "points, so they nearly always win. That's why Seekers get fouled so much. A\n",
      "game of Quidditch only ends when the Snitch is caught, so it can go on for ages\n",
      "- I think the record is three months, they had to keep bringing on substitutes so\n",
      "the players could get some sleep.\n",
      "\"Well, that's it any questions?\"\n",
      "Harry shook his head. He understood what he had to do all right, it was\n",
      "doing it that was going to be the problem.\n",
      "\"We won't practice with the Snitch yet,\" said Wood, carefully shutting it\n",
      "back inside the crate, \"it's too dark, we might lose it. Let's try you out with a few\n",
      "of these.\"\n",
      "He pulled a bag of ordinary golf balls out of his pocket and a few\n",
      "minutes later, he and Harry were up in the air, Wood throwing the golf balls as\n",
      "hard as he could in every direction for Harry to catch.\n",
      "Harry didn't miss a single one, and Wood was delighted. After half an\n",
      "hour, night had really fallen and they couldn't carry on.\n",
      "\"That Quidditch Cup'll have our name on it this year,” said Wood\n",
      "happily as they trudged back up to the castle. \"I wouldn't be surprised if you turn\n",
      "out better than Charlie Weasley, and he could have played for England if he\n",
      "hadn't gone off chasing dragons.\"\n",
      "Perhaps it was because he was now so busy, what with Quidditch practice\n",
      "three evenings a week on top of all his homework, but Harry could hardly\n",
      "believe it when he realized that he'd already been at Hogwarts two months. The\n",

      "decorations put Hermione out of their minds.\n",
      "A thousand live bats fluttered from the walls and ceiling while a thousand\n",
      "more swooped over the tables in low black clouds, making the candles in the\n",

      "Harry was just helping himself to a baked potato when Professor Quirrell\n",
      "came sprinting into the hall, his turban askew and terror on his face. Everyone\n",
      "stared as he reached Professor Dumbledore's chair, slumped against the table,\n",
      "and gasped, \"Troll — in the dungeons - thought you ought to know.\"\n",
      "He then sank to the floor in a dead faint.\n",
      "There was an uproar. It took several purple firecrackers exploding from\n",
      "the end of Professor Dumbledore's wand to bring silence.\n",
      "\"Prefects,\" he rumbled, \"lead your Houses back to the dormitories\n",

      "through! Excuse me, I'm a prefect!\"\n",
      "\"How could a troll get in?\" Harry asked as they climbed the stairs.\n",
      "\"Don't ask me, they're supposed to be really stupid,\" said Ron. \"Maybe\n",
      "Peeves let it in for a Halloween joke.\"\n",
      "They passed different groups of people hurrying in different directions.\n",
      "As they jostled their way through a crowd of confused Hufflepuffs, Harry\n",
      "suddenly grabbed Ron's arm.\n",
      "\"I've just thought - Hermione.\"\n",
      "\"What about her?\"\n",
      "\"She doesn't know about the troll.\"\n",
      "Ron bit his lip.\n",
      "“Oh, all right,” he snapped. \"But Percy'd better not see us.\"\n",
      "Ducking down, they joined the Hufflepuffs going the other way, slipped\n",
      "down a deserted side corridor, and hurried off toward the girls' bathroom. They\n",
      "had just turned the corner when they heard quick footsteps behind them.\n",
      "\"Percy!\" hissed Ron, pulling Harry behind a large stone griffin.\n",
      "Peering around it, however, they saw not Percy but Snape. He crossed the\n",
      "corridor and disappeared from view.\n",
      "\"What's he doing?\" Harry whispered. \"Why isn't he down in the\n",
      "dungeons with the rest of the teachers?\"\n",
      "\"Search me.\"\n",
      "Quietly as possible, they crept along the next corridor after Snape's\n",
      "fading footsteps.\n",
      "\"He's heading for the third floor,\" Harry said, but Ron held up his hand.\n",
      "\"Can you smell something?\"\n",
      "Harry sniffed and a foul stench reached his nostrils, a mixture of old\n",
      "socks and the kind of public toilet no one seems to clean.\n",
      "And then they heard it a low grunting, and the shuffling footfalls of\n",
      "gigantic feet. Ron pointed at the end of a passage to the left, something huge\n",
      "was moving toward them. They shrank into the shadows and watched as it\n",
      "emerged into a patch of moonlight.\n",
      "It was a horrible sight. Twelve feet tall, its skin was a dull, granite gray,\n",
      "its great lumpy body like a boulder with its small bald head perched on top like a\n",
      "coconut. It had short legs thick as tree trunks with flat, horny feet. The smell\n",
      "coming from it was incredible. It was holding a huge wooden club, which\n",
      "dragged along the floor because its arms were so long.\n",
      "The troll stopped next to a doorway and peered inside. It waggled its long\n",
      "ears, making up its tiny mind, then slouched slowly into the room.\n",
      "\"The keys in the lock,\" Harry muttered. \"We could lock it in.\"\n",
      "\"Good idea,\" said Ron nervously.\n",
      "They edged toward the open door, mouths dry, praying the troll wasn't\n",
      "about to come out of it. With one great leap, Harry managed to grab the key,\n",
      "slam the door, and lock it.\n",
      "\"Yes!\"\n",
      "but as\n",
      "a\n",
      "Flushed with their victory, they started to run back up the passage,\n",
      "they reached the corner they heard something that made their hearts stop\n",
      "high, petrified scream and it was coming from the chamber they'd just\n",
      "chained up.\n",
      "\"Oh, no,\" said Ron, pale as the Bloody Baron.\n",
      "\"It's the girls' bathroom!\" Harry gasped.\n",
      "\"Hermione!\" they said together.\n",
      "It was the last thing they wanted to do, but what choice did they have?\n",
      "Wheeling around, they sprinted back to the door and turned the key, fumbling in\n",
      "their panic. Harry pulled the door open and they ran inside.\n",
      "Hermione Granger was shrinking against the wall opposite, looking as if\n",
      "she was about to faint. The troll was advancing on her, knocking the sinks off the\n",
      "walls as it went.\n",
      "\"Confuse it!\" Harry said desperately to Ron, and, seizing a tap, he threw\n",
      "it as hard as he could against the wall.\n",
      "The troll stopped a few feet from Hermione. It lumbered around, blinking\n",
      "stupidly, to see what had made the noise. Its mean little eyes saw Harry. It\n",
      "hesitated, then made for him instead, lifting its club as it went.\n",
      "\"Oy, pea-brain!\" yelled Ron from the other side of the chamber, and he\n",
      "threw a metal pipe at it. The troll didn't even seem to notice the pipe hitting its\n",
      "shoulder, but it heard the yell and paused again, turning its ugly snout toward\n",
      "Ron instead, giving Harry time to run around it.\n",
      "\"Come on, run, run!\" Harry yelled at Hermione, trying to pull her toward\n",
      "the door, but she couldn't move, she was still flat against the wall, her mouth\n",
      "open with terror.\n",
      "The shouting and the echoes seemed to be driving the troll berserk. It\n",
      "roared again and started toward Ron, who was nearest and had no way to escape.\n",
      "Harry then did something that was both very brave and very stupid: He\n",
      "took a great running jump and managed to fasten his arms around the troll's neck\n",
      "from behind. The troll couldn't feel Harry hanging there, but even a troll will\n",
      "notice if you stick a long bit of wood up its nose, and Harry's wand had still been\n",
      "in his hand when he'd jumped – it had gone straight up one of the troll's nostrils.\n",
      "Howling with pain, the troll twisted and flailed its club, with Harry\n",
      "clinging on for dear life; any second, the troll was going to rip him off or catch\n",
      "him a terrible blow with the club.\n",
      "Hermione had sunk to the floor in fright; Ron pulled out his own wand\n",
      "not knowing what he was going to do he heard himself cry the first spell that\n",
      "came into his head: \"Wingardium Leviosa!\"\n",
      "The club flew suddenly out of the troll's hand, rose high, high up into the\n",
      "air, turned slowly over and dropped, with a sickening crack, onto its owner's\n",
      "head. The troll swayed on the spot and then fell flat on its face, with a thud that\n",
      "made the whole room tremble.\n",
      "Harry got to his feet. He was shaking and out of breath. Ron was\n",
      "standing there with his wand still raised, staring at what he had done.\n",
      "It was Hermione who spoke first.\n",
      "\"Is it — dead?”\n",
      "\"I don't think so,” said Harry, I think it's just been knocked out.\"\n",
      "He bent down and pulled his wand out of the troll's nose. It was covered\n",
      "in what looked like lumpy gray glue.\n",
      "\"Urgh - troll boogers.\"\n",
      "He wiped it on the troll's trousers.\n",
      "A sudden slamming and loud footsteps made the three of them look up.\n",
      "They hadn't realized what a racket they had been making, but of course,\n",
      "someone downstairs must have heard the crashes and the troll's roars. A moment\n",
      "later, Professor McGonagall had come bursting into the room, closely followed\n",
      "by Snape, with Quirrell bringing up the rear. Quirrell took one look at the troll,\n",
      "let out a faint whimper, and sat quickly down on a toilet, clutching his heart.\n",
      "Snape bent over the troll. Professor McGonagall was looking at Ron and\n",
      "Harry. Harry had never seen her look so angry. Her lips were white. Hopes of\n",
      "winning fifty points for Gryffindor faded quickly from Harry's mind.\n",
      "\"What on earth were you thinking of?\" said Professor McGonagall, with\n",
      "cold fury in her voice. Harry looked at Ron, who was still standing with his\n",
      "wand in the air. \"You're lucky you weren't killed. Why aren't you in your\n",
      "dormitory?\"\n",
      "Snape gave Harry a swift, piercing look. Harry looked at the floor. He\n",
      "wished Ron would put his wand down.\n",
      "Then a small voice came out of the shadows.\n",
      "\"Please, Professor McGonagall - they were looking for me.\"\n",
      "\"Miss Granger!”\n",
      "Hermione had managed to get to her feet at last.\n",
      "\"I went looking for the troll because I I thought I could deal with it on\n",
      "you know, because I've read all about them.”\n",
      "Ron dropped his wand. Hermione Granger, telling a downright lie to a\n",
      "my own\n",
      "teacher?\n",
      "\"If they hadn't found me, I'd be dead now. Harry stuck his wand up its\n",
      "nose and Ron knocked it out with its own club. They didn't have time to come\n",
      "and fetch anyone. It was about to finish me off when they arrived.\"\n",
      "Harry and Ron tried to look as though this story wasn't new to them.\n",
      "\"Well- in that case...\" said Professor McGonagall, staring at the three\n",
      "of them, \"Miss Granger, you foolish girl, how could you think of tackling a\n",
      "mountain troll on your own?\"\n",
      "Hermione hung her head. Harry was speechless. Hermione was the last\n",
      "person to do anything against the rules, and here she was, pretending she had, to\n",
      "get them out of trouble. It was as if Snape had started handing out sweets.\n",
      "\"Miss Granger, five points will be taken from Gryffindor for this,\" said\n",
      "Professor McGonagall. \"I'm very disappointed in you. If you're not hurt at all,\n",
      "you'd better get off to Gryffindor tower. Students are finishing the feast in their\n",
      "houses.\"\n",
      "Hermione left.\n",
      "Professor McGonagall turned to Harry and Ron.\n",
      "\"Well, I still say you were lucky, but not many first years could have\n",
      "taken on a full-grown mountain troll. You each win Gryffindor five points.\n",
      "Professor Dumbledore will be informed of this. You may go.\"\n",
      "They hurried out of the chamber and didn't speak at all until they had\n",
      "climbed two floors up. It was a relief to be away from the smell of the troll, quite\n",
      "apart from anything else.\n",
      "\"We should have gotten more than ten points,” Ron grumbled.\n",
      "\"Five, you mean, once she's taken off Hermione's.\"\n",
      "\"Good of her to get us out of trouble like that,” Ron admitted. \"Mind\n",
      "you, we did save her.”\n",
      "\"She might not have needed saving if we hadn't locked the thing in with\n",
      "her,\" Harry reminded him.\n",
      "They had reached the portrait of the Fat Lady.\n",
      "\"Pig snout,\" they said and entered.\n",
      "The common room was packed and noisy. Everyone was eating the food\n",
      "that had been sent up. Hermione, however, stood alone by the door, waiting for\n",
      "them. There was a very embarrassed pause. Then, none of them looking at each\n",
      "other, they all said “Thanks,” and hurried off to get plates.\n",
      "But from that moment on, Hermione Granger became their friend. There\n",
      "are some things you can't share without ending up liking each other, and\n",

      "the last-minute Quidditch practice Wood was making them do. She had also lent\n",
      "him Quidditch Through the Ages, which turned out to be a very interesting read.\n",
      "Harry learned that there were seven hundred ways of committing a\n",
      "Quidditch foul and that all of them had happened during a World Cup match in\n",
      "1473; that Seekers were usually the smallest and fastest players, and that most\n",

      "Hermione had become a bit more relaxed about breaking rules since\n",
      "Harry and Ron had saved her from the mountain troll, and she was much nicer\n",
      "for it. The day before Harry's first Quidditch match the three of them were out in\n",
      "the freezing courtyard during break, and she had conjured them up a bright blue\n",
      "fire that could be carried around in a jam jar. They were standing with their\n",
      "backs to it, getting warm, when Snape crossed the yard. Harry noticed at once\n",
      "that Snape was limping. Harry, Ron, and Hermione moved closer together to\n",

      "snapped Ron. \"I'm with Harry. I wouldn't put anything past Snape. But what's\n",
      "he after? What's that dog guarding?”\n",
      "Harry went to bed with his head buzzing with the same question. Neville\n",
      "was snoring loudly, but Harry couldn't sleep. He tried to empty his mind — he\n",
      "needed to sleep, he had to, he had his first Quidditch match in a few hours – but\n",
      "the expression on Snape's face when Harry had seen his leg wasn't easy to\n",
      "forget.\n",

      "\"Just a bit of toast,\" wheedled Hermione.\n",
      "\"I'm not hungry.\"\n",
      "Harry felt terrible. In an hour's time he'd be walking onto the field.\n",
      "\"Harry, you need your strength,\" said Seamus Finnigan. “Seekers are\n",
      "always the ones who get clobbered by the other team.\"\n",
      "“Thanks, Seamus,” said Harry, watching Seamus pile ketchup on his\n",
      "sausages.\n",
      "By eleven o'clock the whole school seemed to be out in the stands around\n",

      "onto one of their brooms, but it was no good - every time they got near him, the\n",

      "she knocked Professor Quirrell headfirst into the row in front. Reaching Snape,\n",

      "fours-coughed and something gold fell into his hand.\n",
      "\"I've got the Snitch!\" he shouted, waving it above his head, and the game\n",
      "ended in complete confusion.\n",
      "\"He didn't catch it, he nearly swallowed it,\" Flint was still howling\n",
      "twenty minutes later, but it made no difference Harry hadn't broken any rules\n",

      "next to him in the stands. \"Why would Snape do somethin' like that?\"\n",
      "Harry, Ron, and Hermione looked at one another, wondering what to tell\n",
      "him. Harry decided on the truth.\n",
      "\"I found out something about him,” he told Hagrid. “He tried to get past\n",

      "\"Nothing,\" said Harry.\n",

      "out!\"\n",
      "Wishing he'd been a bit quicker at thinking up some story, Harry left the\n",

      "Pince where they could find Flamel. They were sure she'd be able to tell them,\n",
      "but they couldn't risk Snape hearing what they were up to.\n",
      "Harry waited outside in the corridor to see if the other two had found\n",
      "anything, but he wasn't very hopeful. They had been looking for two weeks,\n",
      "after A, but as they only had odd moments between lessons it wasn't surprising\n",
      "they'd found nothing. What they really needed was a nice long search without\n",

      "\"It'd be safe to ask them.\"\n",
      "\"Very safe, as they're both dentists,\" said Hermione.\n",
      "Once the holidays had started, Ron and Harry were having too good a time to\n",
      "think much about Flamel. They had the dormitory to themselves and the\n",
      "common room was far emptier than usual, so they were able to get the good\n",
      "armchairs by the fire. They sat by the hour eating anything they could spear on a\n",
      "toasting fork - bread, English muffins, marshmallows and plotting ways of\n",
      "getting Malfoy expelled, which were fun to talk about even if they wouldn't\n",

      "Ron also started teaching Harry wizard chess. This was exactly like\n",
      "Muggle chess except that the figures were alive, which made it a lot like\n",
      "directing troops in battle. Ron's set was very old and battered. Like everything\n",
      "else he owned, it had once belonged to someone else in his family in this\n",

      "knew them so well he never had trouble getting them to do what he wanted.\n",
      "Harry played with chessmen Seamus Finnigan had lent him, and they\n",
      "didn't trust him at all. He wasn't a very good player yet and they kept shouting\n",

      "in the morning, however, the first thing he saw was a small pile of packages at\n",
      "the foot of his bed.\n",
      "\"Merry Christmas,\" said Ron sleepily as Harry scrambled out of bed and\n",
      "pulled on his bathrobe.\n",
      "\"You, too,\" said Harry. \"Will you look at this? I've got some presents!\"\n",
      "\"What did you expect, turnips?” said Ron, turning to his own pile, which\n",
      "was a lot bigger than Harry's.\n",
      "Harry picked up the top parcel. It was wrapped in thick brown paper and\n",
      "scrawled across it was To Harry, from Hagrid. Inside was a roughly cut wooden\n",
      "flute. Hagrid had obviously whittled it himself. Harry blew it - it sounded a bit\n",
      "like an owl.\n",
      "A second, very small parcel contained a note.\n",
      "We received your message and enclose your Christmas present. From\n",
      "Uncle Vernon and Aunt Petunia. Taped to the note was a fifty-pence piece.\n",
      "\"That's friendly,\" said Harry.\n",
      "\"You can keep it,\" said Harry, laughing at how pleased Ron was. \"Hagrid\n",
      "and my aunt and uncle so who sent these?\"\n",
      "Ron was fascinated by the fifty pence.\n",
      "\"Weird!\" he said, 'What a shape! This is money?\"\n",
      "\"I think I know who that one's from,\" said Ron, turning a bit pink and\n",
      "pointing to a very lumpy parcel. \"My mom. I told her you didn't expect any\n",
      "presents and oh, no,\" he groaned, \"she's made you a Weasley sweater.\"\n",
      "Harry had torn open the parcel to find a thick, hand-knitted sweater in\n",
      "emerald green and a large box of homemade fudge.\n",
      "\"Every year she makes us a sweater,” said Ron, unwrapping his own,\n",
      "\"and mine's always maroon.\"\n",
      "\"That's really nice of her,\" said Harry, trying the fudge, which was very\n",
      "tasty.\n",
      "His next present also contained candy - a large box of Chocolate Frogs\n",
      "from Hermione.\n",
      "This only left one parcel. Harry picked it up and felt it. It was very light.\n",
      "He unwrapped it.\n",
      "Something fluid and silvery gray went slithering to the floor where it lay\n",
      "in gleaming folds. Ron gasped.\n",
      "\"I've heard of those,\" he said in a hushed voice, dropping the box of\n",
      "Every Flavor Beans he'd gotten from Hermione. “If that's what I think it is\n",
      "they're really rare, and really valuable.\"\n",
      "\"What is it?\"\n",
      "Harry picked the shining, silvery cloth off the floor. It was strange to the\n",
      "touch, like water woven into material.\n",
      "\"It's an invisibility cloak,\" said Ron, a look of awe on his face. “I'm sure\n",
      "try it on.\"\n",
      "it is\n",
      "—\n",
      "Harry threw the cloak around his shoulders and Ron gave a yell.\n",
      "\"It is! Look down!\"\n",
      "Harry looked down at his feet, but they were gone. He dashed to the\n",
      "mirror. Sure enough, his reflection looked back at him, just his head suspended\n",
      "in midair, his body completely invisible. He pulled the cloak over his head and\n",
      "his reflection vanished completely.\n",
      "\"There's a note!” said Ron suddenly. “A note fell out of it!\"\n",
      "Harry pulled off the cloak and seized the letter. Written in narrow, loopy\n",
      "writing he had never seen before were the following words:\n",
      "Your father left this in my possession before he died.\n",
      "It is time it was returned to you.\n",
      "Use it well.\n",
      "A Very Merry Christmas to you.\n",
      "There was no signature. Harry stared at the note. Ron was admiring the\n",
      "cloak.\n",
      "\"I'd give anything for one of these,\" he said. \"Anything. What's the\n",
      "“Nothing,” said Harry. He felt very strange. Who had sent the cloak? Had\n",
      "it really once belonged to his father?\n",
      "matter?\"\n",
      "Before he could say or think anything else, the dormitory door was flung\n",
      "open and Fred and George Weasley bounded in. Harry stuffed the cloak quickly\n",
      "out of sight. He didn't feel like sharing it with anyone else yet.\n",
      "\"Merry Christmas!\"\n",
      "\"Hey, look - Harry's got a Weasley sweater, too!\"\n",
      "Fred and George were wearing blue sweaters, one with a large yellow F\n",
      "on it, the other a G.\n",
      "\"Harry's is better than ours, though,\" said Fred, holding up Harry's\n",
      "sweater. \"She obviously makes more of an effort if you're not family.\"\n",
      "\"Why aren't you wearing yours, Ron?\" George demanded. \"Come on,\n",
      "get it on, they're lovely and warm.\n",
      "\"I hate maroon,\" Ron moaned halfheartedly as he pulled it over his head.\n",
      "\"You haven't got a letter on yours,\" George observed. “I suppose she\n",
      "thinks you don't forget your name. But we're not stupid we know we're\n",
      "called Gred and Forge.\"\n",
      "\"What's all this noise?\"\n",
      "Percy Weasley stuck his head through the door, looking disapproving. He\n",
      "had clearly gotten halfway through unwrapping his presents as he, too, carried a\n",
      "lumpy sweater over his arm, which Fred seized.\n",
      "\"P for prefect! Get it on, Percy, come on, we're all wearing ours, even\n",
      "Harry got one.”\n",
      "want\n",
      "\"I don't\n",
      "said Percy thickly, as the twins forced the\n",
      "sweater over his head, knocking his glasses askew.\n",
      "\"And you're not sitting with the prefects today, either,\" said George.\n",
      "\"Christmas is a time for family.\"\n",
      "They frog-marched Percy from the room, his arms pinned to his side by\n",
      "his sweater.\n",
      "Harry had never in all his life had such a Christmas dinner. A hundred fat,\n",
      "roast turkeys; mountains of roast and boiled potatoes; platters of chipolatas;\n",
      "tureens of buttered peas, silver boats of thick, rich gravy and cranberry sauce\n",
      "and stacks of wizard crackers every few feet along the table. These fantastic\n",
      "party favors were nothing like the feeble Muggle ones the Dursleys usually\n",
      "bought, with their little plastic toys and their flimsy paper hats inside. Harry\n",
      "pulled a wizard cracker with Fred and it didn't just bang, it went off with a blast\n",
      "like a cannon and engulfed them all in a cloud of blue smoke, while from the\n",
      "inside exploded a rear admiral's hat and several live, white mice. Up at the High\n",
      "Table, Dumbledore had swapped his pointed wizard's hat for a flowered bonnet,\n",
      "and was chuckling merrily at a joke Professor Flitwick had just read him.\n",
      "Flaming Christmas puddings followed the turkey. Percy nearly broke his\n",
      "teeth on a silver sickle embedded in his slice. Harry watched Hagrid getting\n",
      "redder and redder in the face as he called for more wine, finally kissing\n",
      "Professor McGonagall on the cheek, who, to Harry's amazement, giggled and\n",
      "blushed, her top hat lopsided.\n",
      "When Harry finally left the table, he was laden down with a stack of\n",
      "things out of the crackers, including a pack of nonexplodable, luminous\n",
      "balloons, a Grow-Your-Own-Warts kit, and his own new wizard chess set. The\n",
      "white mice had disappeared and Harry had a nasty feeling they were going to\n",
      "end up as Mrs. Norris's Christmas dinner.\n",
      "Harry and the Weasleys spent a happy afternoon having a furious\n",
      "snowball fight on the grounds. Then, cold, wet, and gasping for breath, they\n",
      "returned to the fire in the Gryffindor common room, where Harry broke in his\n",
      "new chess set by losing spectacularly to Ron. He suspected he wouldn't have\n",
      "lost so badly if Percy hadn't tried to help him so much.\n",
      "After a meal of turkey sandwiches, crumpets, trifle, and Christmas cake,\n",
      "everyone felt too full and sleepy to do much before bed except sit and watch\n",
      "Percy chase Fred and George all over Gryffindor tower because they'd stolen his\n",
      "prefect badge.\n",
      "It had been Harry's best Christmas day ever. Yet something had been\n",
      "nagging at the back of his mind all day. Not until he climbed into bed was he\n",
      "free to think about it: the invisibility cloak and whoever had sent it.\n",
      "Ron, full of turkey and cake and with nothing mysterious to bother him,\n",
      "fell asleep almost as soon as he'd drawn the curtains of his four-poster. Harry\n",
      "leaned over the side of his own bed and pulled the cloak out from under it.\n",
      "His father's…..this had been his father's. He let the material flow over his\n",
      "hands, smoother than silk, light as air. Use it well, the note had said.\n",
      "He had to try it, now. He slipped out of bed and wrapped the cloak\n",
      "around himself. Looking down at his legs, he saw only moonlight and shadows.\n",
      "It was a very funny feeling.\n",
      "Use it well.\n",
      "Suddenly, Harry felt wide-awake. The whole of Hogwarts was open to\n",
      "him in this cloak. Excitement flooded through him as he stood there in the dark\n",
      "and silence. He could go anywhere in this, anywhere, and Filch would never\n",
      "know.\n",
      "Ron grunted in his sleep. Should Harry wake him? Something held him\n",
      "back his father's cloak he felt that this time the first time - he wanted\n",
      "to use it alone.\n",
      "He crept out of the dormitory, down the stairs, across the common room,\n",
      "and climbed through the portrait hole.\n",
      "\"Who's there?\" squawked the Fat Lady. Harry said nothing. He walked\n",
      "quickly down the corridor.\n",
      "Where should he go? He stopped, his heart racing, and thought. And then\n",
      "it came to him. The Restricted Section in the library. He'd be able to read as long\n",
      "as he liked, as long as it took to find out who Flamel was. He set off, drawing the\n",
      "invisibility cloak tight around him as he walked.\n",
      "The library was pitch-black and very eerie. Harry lit a lamp to see his\n",
      "way along the rows of books. The lamp looked as if it was floating along in\n",
      "midair, and even though Harry could feel his arm supporting it, the sight gave\n",
      "him the creeps.\n",
      "The Restricted Section was right at the back of the library. Stepping\n",
      "carefully over the rope that separated these books from the rest of the library, he\n",
      "held up his lamp to read the titles.\n",
      "They didn't tell him much. Their peeling, faded gold letters spelled\n",
      "words in languages Harry couldn't understand. Some had no title at all. One\n",
      "book had a dark stain on it that looked horribly like blood. The hairs on the back\n",
      "of Harry's neck prickled. Maybe he was imagining it, maybe not, but he thought\n",
      "a faint whispering was coming from the books, as though they knew someone\n",
      "was there who shouldn't be.\n",
      "He had to start somewhere. Setting the lamp down carefully on the floor,\n",
      "he looked along the bottom shelf for an interesting looking book. A large black\n",
      "and silver volume caught his eye. He pulled it out with difficulty, because it was\n",
      "very heavy, and, balancing it on his knee, let it fall open.\n",
      "A piercing, bloodcurdling shriek split the silence the book was\n",
      "screaming! Harry snapped it shut, but the shriek went on and on, one high,\n",
      "unbroken, earsplitting note. He stumbled backward and knocked over his lamp,\n",
      "which went out at once. Panicking, he heard footsteps coming down the corridor\n",
      "outside stuffing the shrieking book back on the shelf, he ran for it. He passed\n",
      "Filch in the doorway; Filch's pale, wild eyes looked straight through him, and\n",
      "Harry slipped under Filch's outstretched arm and streaked off up the corridor, the\n",
      "book's shrieks still ringing in his ears.\n",
      "He came to a sudden halt in front of a tall suit of armor. He had been so\n",
      "busy getting away from the library, he hadn't paid attention to where he was\n",
      "going. Perhaps because it was dark, he didn't recognize where he was at all.\n",
      "There was a suit of armor near the kitchens, he knew, but he must be five floors\n",
      "above there.\n",
      "\"You asked me to come directly to you, Professor, if anyone was\n",
      "wandering around at night, and somebody's been in the library Restricted\n",
      "Section.\"\n",
      "Harry felt the blood drain out of his face. Wherever he was, Filch must\n",
      "know a shortcut, because his soft, greasy voice was getting nearer, and to his\n",
      "horror, it was Snape who replied, \"The Restricted Section? Well, they can't be\n",
      "far, we'll catch them.\"\n",
      "Harry stood rooted to the spot as Filch and Snape came around the corner\n",
      "ahead. They couldn't see him, of course, but it was a narrow corridor and if they\n",
      "came much nearer they'd knock right into him the cloak didn't stop him from\n",
      "being solid.\n",
      "He backed away as quietly as he could. A door stood ajar to his left. It\n",
      "was his only hope. He squeezed through it, holding his breath, trying not to\n",
      "move it, and to his relief he managed to get inside the room without their\n",
      "noticing anything. They walked straight past, and Harry leaned against the wall,\n",
      "breathing deeply, listening to their footsteps dying away. That had been close,\n",
      "very close. It was a few seconds before he noticed anything about the room he\n",
      "had hidden in.\n",
      "It looked like an unused classroom. The dark shapes of desks and chairs\n",
      "were piled against the walls, and there was an upturned wastepaper basket - but\n",
      "propped against the wall facing him was something that didn't look as if it\n",
      "belonged there, something that looked as if someone had just put it there to keep\n",
      "it out of the way.\n",
      "It was a magnificent mirror, as high as the ceiling, with an ornate gold\n",
      "frame, standing on two clawed feet. There was an inscription carved around the\n",
      "top: Erised stra ehru oyt ube cafru oyt on wohsi. His panic fading now that there\n",
      "was no sound of Filch and Snape, Harry moved nearer to the mirror, wanting to\n",
      "look at himself but see no reflection again. He stepped in front of it.\n",
      "He had to clap his hands to his mouth to stop himself from screaming. He\n",
      "whirled around. His heart was pounding far more furiously than when the book\n",
      "had screamed for he had seen not only himself in the mirror, but a whole\n",
      "crowd of people standing right behind him.\n",
      "But the room was empty. Breathing very fast, he turned slowly back to\n",
      "the mirror.\n",
      "There he was, reflected in it, white and scared-looking, and there,\n",
      "reflected behind him, were at least ten others. Harry looked over his shoulder\n",
      "but still, no one was there. Or were they all invisible, too? Was he in fact in a\n",
      "room full of invisible people and this mirror's trick was that it reflected them,\n",
      "invisible or not?\n",
      "He looked in the mirror again. A woman standing right behind his\n",
      "reflection was smiling at him and waving. He reached out a hand and felt the air\n",
      "behind him. If she was really there, he'd touch her, their reflections were so\n",
      "close together, but he felt only air – she and the others existed only in the mirror.\n",
      "She was a very pretty woman. She had dark red hair and her eyes her\n",
      "eyes are just like mine, Harry thought, edging a little closer to the glass. Bright\n",
      "green exactly the same shape, but then he noticed that she was crying;\n",
      "smiling, but crying at the same time. The tall, thin, black-haired man standing\n",
      "next to her put his arm around her. He wore glasses, and his hair was very\n",
      "untidy. It stuck up at the back, just as Harry's did.\n",
      "Harry was so close to the mirror now that his nose was nearly touching\n",
      "that of his reflection.\n",
      "\"Mom?\" he whispered. \"Dad?\"\n",
      "They just looked at him, smiling. And slowly, Harry looked into the faces\n",
      "of the other people in the mirror, and saw other pairs of green eyes like his, other\n",
      "noses like his, even a little old man who looked as though he had Harry's\n",
      "knobbly knees - Harry was looking at his family, for the first time in his life.\n",
      "The Potters smiled and waved at Harry and he stared hungrily back at\n",
      "them, his hands pressed flat against the glass as though he was hoping to fall\n",
      "right through it and reach them. He had a powerful kind of ache inside him, half\n",
      "joy, half terrible sadness.\n",
      "How long he stood there, he didn't know. The reflections did not fade\n",
      "and he looked and looked until a distant noise brought him back to his senses.\n",
      "He couldn't stay here, he had to find his way back to bed. He tore his eyes away\n",
      "from his mother's face, whispered, \"I'll come back,\" and hurried from the room.\n",
      "\"You could have woken me up,” said Ron, crossly.\n",
      "\"You can come tonight, I'm going back, I want to show you the mirror.\n",

      "\"You see, Dumbledore was right, that mirror could drive you mad,” said\n",
      "Ron, when Harry told him about these dreams.\n",

      "breaks. Harry had even less time than the other two, because Quidditch practice\n",
      "had started again.\n",
      "Wood was working the team harder than ever. Even the endless rain that\n",
      "had replaced the snow couldn't dampen his spirits. The Weasleys complained\n",
      "that Wood was becoming a fanatic, but Harry was on Wood's side. If they won\n",
      "their next match, against Hufflepuff, they would overtake Slytherin in the house\n",
      "championship for the first time in seven years. Quite apart from wanting to win,\n",
      "Harry found that he had fewer nightmares when he was tired out after training.\n",
      "Then, during one particularly wet and muddy practice session, Wood\n",
      "gave the team a bit of bad news. He'd just gotten very angry with the Weasleys,\n",
      "who kept dive-bombing each other and pretending to fall off their brooms.\n",
      "\"Will you stop messing around!\" he yelled. “That's exactly the sort of\n",

      "for any excuse to knock points off Gryffindor!\"\n",
      "George Weasley really did fall off his broom at these words.\n",
      "\"Snape's refereeing?” he spluttered through a mouthful of mud. \"When's\n",

      "The rest of the team landed next to George to complain, too.\n",
      "\"It's not my fault,\" said Wood. \"We've just got to make sure we play a\n",

      "Which was all very well, thought Harry, but he had another reason for\n",
      "not wanting Snape near him while he was playing Quidditch....\n",
      "The rest of the team hung back to talk to one another as usual at the end\n",
      "of practice, but Harry headed straight back to the Gryffindor common room,\n",

      "\"What's the matter with you? You look terrible.”\n",
      "Speaking quietly so that no one else would hear, Harry told the other two\n",
      "about Snape's sudden, sinister desire to be a Quidditch referee.\n",
      "\"Don't play,\" said Hermione at once.\n",
      "\"Say you're ill,\" said Ron.\n",
      "\"Pretend to break your leg,\" Hermione suggested.\n",

      "At that moment Neville toppled into the common room. How he had\n",
      "managed to climb through the portrait hole was anyone's guess, because his legs\n",
      "had been stuck together with what they recognized at once as the Leg-Locker\n",
      "Curse. He must have had to bunny hop all the way up to Gryffindor tower.\n",
      "Everyone fell over laughing except Hermione, who leapt up and\n",
      "performed the countercurse. Neville's legs sprang apart and he got to his feet,\n",
      "trembling. \"What happened?” Hermione asked him, leading him over to sit with\n",
      "Harry and Ron.\n",
      "\"Malfoy,\" said Neville shakily. \"I met him outside the library. He said\n",

      "Neville shook his head.\n",

      "\"You've got to stand up to him, Neville!” said Ron. \"He's used to\n",
      "walking all over people, but that's no reason to lie down in front of him and\n",
      "make it easier.\"\n",
      "\"There's no need to tell me I'm not brave enough to be in Gryffindor,\n",
      "Malfoy's already done that,\" Neville choked out.\n",

      "As Neville walked away, Harry looked at the Famous Wizard card.\n",
      "\"Dumbledore again,” he said, “He was the first one I ever —”\n",
      "He gasped. He stared at the back of the card. Then he looked up at Ron\n",
      "and Hermione.\n",

      "his work on alchemy with his partner, Nicolas Flamel’!”\n",
      "Hermione jumped to her feet. She hadn't looked so excited since they'd\n",
      "gotten back the marks for their very first piece of homework.\n",
      "\"Stay there!\" she said, and she sprinted up the stairs to the girls'\n",
      "dormitories. Harry and Ron barely had time to exchange mystified looks before\n",
      "she was dashing back, an enormous old book in her arms.\n",
      "\"I never thought to look in here!\" she whispered excitedly. \"I got this out\n",
      "of the library weeks ago for a bit of light reading.\"\n",
      "\"Light?\" said Ron, but Hermione told him to be quiet until she'd looked\n",
      "something up, and started flicking frantically through the pages, muttering to\n",
      "herself.\n",
      "him.\n",
      "At last she found what she was looking for.\n",
      "\"I knew it! I knew it!\"\n",

      "\"Oh, honestly, don't you two read? Look - read that, there.\"\n",
      "She pushed the book toward them, and Harry and Ron read:\n",
      "The ancient study of alchemy is concerned with making the Sorcerer's Stone,\n",
      "a legendary substance with astonishing powers. The stone will transform any\n",
      "metal into pure gold. It also produces the Elixir of Life, which will make the\n",
      "drinker immortal.\n",
      "There have been many reports of the Sorcerer's Stone over the centuries, but\n",
      "the only Stone currently in existence belongs to Mr. Nicolas Flamel, the noted\n",
      "alchemist and opera lover. Mr. Flamel, who celebrated his six hundred and sixty-\n",
      "fifth birthday last year, enjoys a quiet life in Devon with his wife, Perenelle (six\n",
      "hundred and fifty-eight).\n",
      "\"See?\" said Hermione, when Harry and Ron had finished. “The dog must be\n",

      "for him, because they're friends and he knew someone was after it, that's why he\n",
      "wanted the Stone moved out of Gringotts!\"\n",
      "\"A stone that makes gold and stops you from ever dying!\" said Harry.\n",
      "\"No wonder Snape's after it! Anyone would want it.\"\n",
      "\"And no wonder we couldn't find Flamel in that Study of Recent\n",
      "Developments in Wizardry,\" said Ron. \"He's not exactly recent if he's six\n",

      "The next morning in Defense Against the Dark Arts, while copying down\n",
      "different ways of treating werewolf bites, Harry and Ron were still discussing\n",
      "what they'd do with a Sorcerer's Stone if they had one. It wasn't until Ron said\n",
      "he'd buy his own Quidditch team that Harry remembered about Snape and the\n",

      "either. The idea of overtaking Slytherin in the house championship was\n",
      "wonderful, no one had done it for seven years, but would they be allowed to,\n",
      "with such a biased referee?\n",
      "Harry didn't know whether he was imagining it or not, but he seemed to\n",

      "Harry knew, when they wished him good luck outside the locker rooms the\n",
      "next afternoon, that Ron and Hermione were wondering whether they'd ever see\n",

      "Ron and Hermione, meanwhile, had found a place in the stands next to\n",
      "Neville, who couldn't understand why they looked so grim and worried, or why\n",
      "they had both brought their wands to the match. Little did Harry know that Ron\n",
      "and Hermione had been secretly practicing the Leg-Locker Curse. They'd gotten\n",

      "The trees were so thick he couldn't see where Snape had gone. He flew\n",
      "in circles, lower and lower, brushing the top branches of trees until he heard\n",
      "voices. He glided toward them and landed noiselessly in a towering beech tree.\n",
      "He climbed carefully along one of the branches, holding tight to his\n",

      "Below, in a shadowy clearing, stood Snape, but he wasn't alone. Quirrell\n",

      "\"B-but I d-d-don't\n",
      "\"Very well,\" Snape cut in. \"We'll have another little chat soon, when\n",
      "you've had time to think things over and decided where your loyalties lie.\"\n",
      "He threw his cloak over his head and strode out of the clearing. It was\n",

      "Every time they passed the third-floor corridor, Harry, Ron, and\n",
      "Hermione would press their ears to the door to check that Fluffy was still\n",

      "days he gave him an encouraging sort of smile, and Ron had started telling\n",
      "people off for laughing at Quirrell's stutter.\n",
      "Hermione, however, had more on her mind than the Sorcerer's Stone.\n",
      "She had started drawing up study schedules and color coding all her notes. Harry\n",

      "\"I'll never remember this,\" Ron burst out one afternoon, throwing down\n",
      "his quill and looking longingly out of the library window. It was the first really\n",
      "fine day they'd had in months. The sky was a clear, forget-me-not blue, and\n",
      "there was a feeling in the air of summer coming.\n",

      "\"Don' go shoutin' about it, what's the matter with yeh?\"\n",
      "\"There are a few things we wanted to ask you, as a matter of fact,\" said\n",

      "\"Do you think it had anything to do with the Stone?\"\n",
      "\"I'm going to see what section he was in,” said Ron, who'd had enough\n",
      "of working. He came back a minute later with a pile of books in his arms and\n",
      "slammed them down on the table.\n",
      "\"Dragons!\" he whispered. \"Hagrid was looking up stuff about dragons!\n",
      "Look at these: Dragon Species of Great Britain and Ireland; From Egg to\n",
      "Inferno, A Dragon Keeper's Guide.\"\n",
      "\"Hagrid's always wanted a dragon, he told me so the first time I ever met\n",
      "him,\" said Harry.\n",
      "\"But it's against our laws,\" said Ron. \"Dragon breeding was outlawed by\n",
      "the Warlocks' Convention of 1709, everyone knows that. It's hard to stop\n",
      "Muggles from noticing us if we're keeping dragons in the back garden -\n",
      "anyway, you can't tame dragons, it's dangerous. You should see the burns\n",
      "Charlie's got off wild ones in Romania.”\n",
      "\"But there aren't wild dragons in Britain?\" said Harry.\n",
      "\"Of course there are,\" said Ron. “Common Welsh Green and Hebridean\n",
      "Blacks. The Ministry of Magic has a job hushing them up, I can tell you. Our\n",

      "\"So what on earth's Hagrid up to?\" said Hermione.\n",
      "When they knocked on the door of the gamekeeper's hut an hour later, they\n",
      "were surprised to see that all the curtains were closed. Hagrid called \"Who is it?\"\n",
      "before he let them in, and then shut the door quickly behind them.\n",
      "It was stifling hot inside. Even though it was such a warm day, there was\n",
      "a blazing fire in the grate. Hagrid made them tea and offered them stoat\n",
      "sandwiches, which they refused.\n",
      "\"So\n",
      "yeh wanted to ask me somethin'?\"\n",
      "\"Yes,\" said Harry. There was no point beating around the bush. \"We were\n",
      "wondering if you could tell us what's guarding the Sorcerer's Stone apart from\n",
      "Fluffy.\"\n",
      "Hagrid frowned at him.\n",
      "\"O' course I can't,\" he said. “Number one, I don' know meself. Number\n",
      "two, yeh know too much already, so I wouldn' tell yeh if I could. That Stone's\n",
      "here fer a good reason. It was almost stolen outta Gringotts — I s'ppose yeh've\n",
      "worked that out an' all? Beats me how yeh even know abou' Fluffy.\"\n",
      "\"Oh, come on, Hagrid, you might not want to tell us, but you do know,\n",
      "you know everything that goes on round here,” said Hermione in a warm,\n",
      "flattering voice. Hagrid's beard twitched and they could tell he was smiling. \"We\n",
      "only wondered who had done the guarding, really.\" Hermione went on. \"We\n",
      "wondered who Dumbledore had trusted enough to help him, apart from you.\"\n",
      "Hagrid's chest swelled at these last words. Harry and Ron beamed at\n",
      "Hermione.\n",
      "\"Well, I don' s'pose it could hurt ter tell yeh that...let's see...he\n",
      "borrowed Fluffy from me...then some o' the teachers did enchantments...\n",
      "Professor Sprout\n",
      "Professor Flitwick Professor McGonagall —” he ticked\n",
      "them off on his fingers, \"Professor Quirrell - an' Dumbledore himself did\n",
      "somethin', o' course. Hang on, I've forgotten someone. Oh yeah, Professor\n",
      "Snape.\"\n",
      "—\n",
      "\"Snape?\"\n",
      "\"Yeah-yer not still on abou' that, are yeh? Look, Snape helped protect\n",
      "the Stone, he's not about ter steal it.\"\n",
      "Harry knew Ron and Hermione were thinking the same as he was. If\n",
      "Snape had been in on protecting the Stone, it must have been easy to find out\n",
      "how the other teachers had guarded it. He probably knew everything - except,\n",
      "it seemed, Quirrell's spell and how to get past Fluffy.\n",
      "\"You're the only one who knows how to get past Fluffy. aren't you,\n",
      "Hagrid?” said Harry anxiously. “And you wouldn't tell anyone, would you? Not\n",
      "even one of the teachers?\"\n",
      "\"Not a soul knows except me an' Dumbledore,\" said Hagrid proudly.\n",
      "\"Well, that's something,\" Harry muttered to the others. \"Hagrid, can we\n",
      "window open? I'm boiling.\"\n",
      "have a\n",
      "\"Can't, Harry, sorry,\" said Hagrid. Harry noticed him glance at the fire.\n",
      "Harry looked at it, too.\n",
      "\"Hagrid - what's that?\"\n",
      "But he already knew what it was. In the very heart of the fire, underneath\n",
      "the kettle, was a huge, black egg.\n",
      "\"Ah,\" said Hagrid, fiddling nervously with his beard, \"That's er...\"\n",
      "\"Where did you get it, Hagrid?” said Ron, crouching over the fire to get a\n",
      "closer look at the egg. “It must've cost you a fortune.\"\n",
      "\"Won it,\" said Hagrid. “Las' night. I was down in the village havin' a few\n",
      "drinks an' got into a game o' cards with a stranger. Think he was quite glad ter\n",
      "get rid of it, ter be honest.\"\n",
      "\"But what are you going to do with it when it's hatched?” said Hermione.\n",
      "\"Well, I've bin doin' some readin',” said Hagrid, pulling a large book\n",
      "from under his pillow. \"Got this outta the library - Dragon Breeding for\n",
      "Pleasure and Profit - it's a bit outta date, o’ course, but it's all in here. Keep the\n",

      "\"Hagrid, you live in a wooden house,\" she said.\n",
      "But Hagrid wasn't listening. He was humming merrily as he stoked the\n",
      "So now they had something else to worry about: what might happen to\n",
      "Hagrid if anyone found out he was hiding an illegal dragon in his hut.\n",
      "\"Wonder what it's like to have a peaceful life,\" Ron sighed, as evening\n",
      "after evening they struggled through all the extra homework they were getting.\n",
      "Hermione had now started making study schedules for Harry and Ron, too. It\n",
      "was driving them nuts.\n",
      "Then, one breakfast time, Hedwig brought Harry another note from\n",
      "Hagrid. He had written only two words: It's hatching.\n",
      "Ron wanted to skip Herbology and go straight down to the hut. Hermione\n",
      "wouldn't hear of it.\n",
      "hatching?\"\n",
      "\"Hermione, how many times in our lives are we going to see a dragon\n",
      "\"We've got lessons, we'll get into trouble, and that's nothing to what\n",
      "Hagrid's going to be in when someone finds out what he's doing—\n",
      "\"Shut up!\" Harry whispered.\n",
      "Malfoy was only a few feet away and he had stopped dead to listen. How\n",
      "much had he heard? Harry didn't like the look on Malfoy's face at all.\n",
      "Ron and Hermione argued all the way to Herbology and in the end,\n",
      "Hermione agreed to run down to Hagrid's with the other two during morning\n",
      "break. When the bell sounded from the castle at the end of their lesson, the three\n",
      "of them dropped their trowels at once and hurried through the grounds to the\n",
      "edge of the forest. Hagrid greeted them, looking flushed and excited.\n",
      "\"It's nearly out.\" He ushered them inside.\n",
      "The egg was lying on the table. There were deep cracks in it. Something\n",
      "was moving inside; a funny clicking noise was coming from it.\n",
      "They all drew their chairs up to the table and watched with bated breath.\n",
      "All at once there was scraping noise and the egg split open. The baby\n",
      "dragon flopped onto the table. It wasn't exactly pretty; Harry thought it looked\n",
      "like a crumpled, black umbrella. Its spiny wings were huge compared to its\n",
      "skinny jet body, it had a long snout with wide nostrils, the stubs of horns and\n",
      "bulging, orange eyes.\n",
      "It sneezed. A couple of sparks flew out of its snout.\n",
      "“Isn’t he beautiful?” Hagrid murmured. He reached out a hand to stroke\n",
      "the dragon's head. It snapped at his fingers, showing pointed fangs.\n",
      "\"Bless him, look, he knows his mommy!\" said Hagrid.\n",

      "From being one of the most popular and admired people at the school,\n",

      "Quirrell's footsteps had disappeared, then peered into the classroom. It was\n",
      "empty, but a door stood ajar at the other end. Harry was halfway toward it before\n",
      "he remembered what he'd promised himself about not meddling.\n",
      "All the same, he'd have gambled twelve Sorcerer's Stones that Snape had\n",
      "just left the room, and from what Harry had just heard, Snape would be walking\n",
      "with a new spring in his step · Quirrell seemed to have given in at last.\n",
      "Harry went back to the library, where Hermione was testing Ron on\n",

      "what do we do, Harry?\"\n",
      "The light of adventure was kindling again in Ron's eyes, but Hermione\n",
      "answered before Harry could.\n",
      "\"Go to Dumbledore. That's what we should have done ages ago. If we try\n",
      "anything ourselves we'll be thrown out for sure.\"\n",
      "\"But we've got no proof!\" said Harry. “Quirrell's too scared to back us\n",
      "up. Snape's only got to say he doesn't know how the troll got in at Halloween\n",
      "and that he was nowhere near the third floor - who do you think they'll believe,\n",
      "him or us? It's not exactly a secret we hate him, Dumbledore'll think we made it\n",
      "up to get him sacked. Filch wouldn't help us if his life depended on it, he's too\n",
      "friendly with Snape, and the more students get thrown out, the better, he'll think.\n",

      "what they'd got.\n",
      "At eleven o'clock that night, they said good-bye to Ron in the common\n",

      "ray of moonlight through the branches above lit a spot of silver-blue blood on\n",
      "the fallen leaves.\n",
      "Harry saw that Hagrid looked very worried.\n",
      "\"Could a werewolf be killing the unicorns?\" Harry asked.\n",
      "\"Not fast enough,\" said Hagrid. \"It's not easy ter catch a unicorn, they're\n",
      "powerful magic creatures. I never knew one ter be hurt before.”\n",
      "They walked past a mossy tree stump. Harry could hear running water;\n",
      "there must be a stream somewhere close by. There were still spots of unicorn\n",
      "blood here and there along the winding path.\n",
      "\"You all right, Hermione?” Hagrid whispered. “Don' worry, it can't've\n",
      "gone far if it's this badly hurt, an' then we'll be able ter GET BEHIND THAT\n",
      "TREE!\"\n",
      "Hagrid seized Harry and Hermione and hoisted them off the path behind\n",
      "a towering oak. He pulled out an arrow and fitted it into his crossbow, raising it,\n",
      "ready to fire. The three of them listened. Something was slithering over dead\n",
      "leaves nearby: it sounded like a cloak trailing along the ground. Hagrid was\n",
      "squinting up the dark path, but after a few seconds, the sound faded away.\n",
      "\"I knew it,\" he murmured. “There's summat in here that shouldn' be.\"\n",
      "\"A werewolf?” Harry suggested.\n",
      "\"That wasn' no werewolf an' it wasn' no unicorn, neither,” said Hagrid\n",
      "grimly. \"Right, follow me, but careful, now.\"\n",
      "They walked more slowly, ears straining for the faintest sound. Suddenly,\n",
      "in a clearing ahead, something definitely moved.\n",
      "\"Who's there?\" Hagrid called. \"Show yerself - I'm armed!\"\n",
      "And into the clearing came\n",
      "was it a man, or a horse? To the waist, a\n",
      "man, with red hair and beard, but below that was a horse's gleaming chestnut\n",
      "body with a long, reddish tail. Harry and Hermione's jaws dropped.\n",
      "\"Oh, it's you, Ronan,” said Hagrid in relief. \"How are yeh?\"\n",
      "He walked forward and shook the centaur's hand.\n",
      "\"Good evening to you, Hagrid,\" said Ronan. He had a deep, sorrowful\n",
      "voice. \"Were you going to shoot me?\"\n",
      "\"Can't be too careful, Ronan,\" said Hagrid, patting his crossbow.\n",
      "“There's summat bad loose in this forest. This is Harry Potter an’ Hermione\n",
      "Granger, by the way. Students up at the school. An' this is Ronan, you two. He's\n",
      "a centaur.\n",
      "\"We'd noticed,\" said Hermione faintly.\n",
      "\"Good evening,\" said Ronan. \"Students, are you? And do you learn\n",
      "much, up at the school?\"\n",
      "\"Erm\"\n",
      "\"A bit,\" said Hermione timidly.\n",
      "\"A bit. Well, that's something.\" Ronan sighed. He flung back his head\n",
      "and stared at the sky. \"Mars is bright tonight.\"\n",
      "\"Yeah,\" said Hagrid, glancing up, too. \"Listen, I'm glad we've run inter\n",
      "yeh, Ronan, 'cause there's a unicorn bin hurt - you seen anythin'?\"\n",
      "Ronan didn't answer immediately. He stared unblinkingly upward, then\n",
      "sighed again.\n",
      "\"Always the innocent are the first victims,” he said. \"So it has been for\n",
      "ages past, so it is now.\"\n",
      "\"Yeah,\" said Hagrid, \"but have yeh seen anythin' Ronan? Anythin'\n",
      "unusual?\"\n",
      "\"Mars is bright tonight,\" Ronan repeated, while Hagrid watched him\n",
      "impatiently. \"Unusually bright.\"\n",
      "\"Yeah, but I was meanin' anythin' unusual a bit nearer home, said\n",
      "Hagrid. \"So yeh haven't noticed anythin' strange?\"\n",
      "Yet again, Ronan took a while to answer. At last, he said, “The forest\n",
      "hides many secrets.\"\n",
      "A movement in the trees behind Ronan made Hagrid raise his bow again,\n",
      "but it was only a second centaur, black-haired and -bodied and wilder-looking\n",
      "than Ronan.\n",
      "\"Hullo, Bane,\" said Hagrid. \"All right?\"\n",
      "\"Good evening, Hagrid, I hope you are well?\"\n",
      "\"Well enough. Look, I've jus' bin askin' Ronan, you seen anythin' odd in\n",
      "here lately? There's a unicorn bin injured - would yeh know anythin' about it?\"\n",
      "Bane walked over to stand next to Ronan. He looked skyward. “Mars is\n",
      "bright tonight,\" he said simply.\n",
      "\"We've heard,\" said Hagrid grumpily. “Well, if either of you do see\n",
      "anythin', let me know, won't yeh? We'll be off, then.\"\n",
      "Harry and Hermione followed him out of the clearing, staring over their\n",
      "shoulders at Ronan and Bane until the trees blocked their view.\n",
      "\"Never,\" said Hagrid irritably, “try an' get a straight answer out of a\n",
      "centaur. Ruddy stargazers. Not interested in anythin' closer'n the moon.\"\n",
      "\"Are there many of them in here?” asked Hermione.\n",
      "\"Oh, a fair few....Keep themselves to themselves mostly, but they're\n",
      "good enough about turnin' up if ever I want a word. They're deep, mind,\n",
      "centaurs...they know things...jus' don' let on much.\"\n",
      "\"D'you think that was a centaur we heard earlier?\" said Harry.\n",
      "\"Did that sound like hooves to you? Nah, if yeh ask me, that was what's\n",
      "bin killin' the unicorns – never heard anythin' like it before.”\n",
      "They walked on through the dense, dark trees. Harry kept looking\n",
      "nervously over his shoulder. He had the nasty feeling they were being watched.\n",
      "He was very glad they had Hagrid and his crossbow with them. They had just\n",
      "passed a bend in the path when Hermione grabbed Hagrid's arm.\n",
      "\"Hagrid! Look! Red sparks, the others are in trouble!\"\n",
      "\"You two wait here!” Hagrid shouted. “Stay on the path, I'll come back\n",
      "for yeh!\"\n",
      "They heard him crashing away through the undergrowth and stood\n",
      "looking at each other, very scared, until they couldn't hear anything but the\n",
      "rustling of leaves around them.\n",
      "“You don't think they've been hurt, do you?\" whispered Hermione.\n",
      "\"I don't care if Malfoy has, but if something's got Neville…..it's our fault\n",
      "he's here in the first place.\"\n",
      "The minutes dragged by. Their ears seemed sharper than usual. Harry's\n",
      "seemed to be picking up every sigh of the wind, every cracking twig. What was\n",
      "going on? Where were the others?\n",
      "At last, a great crunching noise announced Hagrid's return. Malfoy,\n",
      "Neville, and Fang were with him. Hagrid was fuming. Malfoy, it seemed, had\n",
      "sneaked up behind Neville and grabbed him as a joke. Neville had panicked and\n",
      "sent up the sparks.\n",
      "\"We'll be lucky ter catch anythin' now, with the racket you two were\n",
      "makin'. Right, we're changin' groups Neville, you stay with me an'\n",
      "Hermione, Harry, you go with Fang an' this idiot. I'm sorry,\" Hagrid added in a\n",
      "whisper to Harry, \"but he'll have a harder time frightenin' you, an' we've gotta\n",
      "get this done.\"\n",
      "So Harry set off into the heart of the forest with Malfoy and Fang. They\n",
      "walked for nearly half an hour, deeper and deeper into the forest, until the path\n",
      "became almost impossible to follow because the trees were so thick. Harry\n",
      "thought the blood seemed to be getting thicker. There were splashes on the roots\n",
      "of a tree, as though the poor creature had been thrashing around in pain close by.\n",
      "Harry could see a clearing ahead, through the tangled branches of an ancient\n",
      "oak.\n",
      "\"Look\"he murmured, holding out his arm to stop Malfoy.\n",
      "Something bright white was gleaming on the ground. They inched closer.\n",
      "It was the unicorn all right, and it was dead. Harry had never seen\n",
      "anything so beautiful and sad. Its long, slender legs were stuck out at odd angles\n",
      "where it had fallen and its mane was spread pearly-white on the dark leaves.\n",
      "Harry had taken one step toward it when a slithering sound made him\n",
      "freeze where he stood. A bush on the edge of the clearing quivered.... Then, out\n",
      "of the shadows, a hooded figure came crawling across the ground like some\n",
      "stalking beast. Harry, Malfoy, and Fang stood transfixed. The cloaked figure\n",
      "reached the unicorn, lowered its head over the wound in the animal's side, and\n",
      "began to drink its blood.\n",
      "\"AAAAAAAAAARGH!\"\n",
      "Malfoy let out a terrible scream and bolted so did Fang. The hooded\n",
      "figure raised its head and looked right at Harry unicorn blood was dribbling\n",
      "down its front. It got to its feet and came swiftly toward Harry — he couldn't\n",
      "move for fear.\n",
      "Then a pain like he'd never felt before pierced his head; it was as though\n",
      "his scar were on fire. Half blinded, he staggered backward. He heard hooves\n",
      "behind him, galloping, and something jumped clean over Harry, charging at the\n",
      "figure.\n",
      "The pain in Harry's head was so bad he fell to his knees. It took a minute\n",
      "or two to pass. When he looked up, the figure had gone. A centaur was standing\n",
      "over him, not Ronan or Bane; this one looked younger; he had white-blond hair\n",
      "and a palomino body.\n",
      "\"Are you all right?\" said the centaur, pulling Harry to his feet.\n",
      "\"Yes-\n",
      "thank you\n",
      "- what was that?”\n",
      "The centaur didn't answer. He had astonishingly blue eyes, like pale\n",
      "sapphires. He looked carefully at Harry, his eyes lingering on the scar that stood\n",
      "out, livid, on Harry's forehead.\n",
      "\"You are the Potter boy,\" he said. “You had better get back to Hagrid.\n",
      "The forest is not safe at this time especially for you. Can you ride? It will be\n",
      "quicker this way.\n",
      "\"My name is Firenze,” he added, as he lowered himself on to his front\n",
      "legs so that Harry could clamber onto his back.\n",
      "There was suddenly a sound of more galloping from the other side of the\n",
      "clearing. Ronan and Bane came bursting through the trees, their flanks heaving\n",
      "and sweaty.\n",
      "—\n",
      "\"Firenze!\" Bane thundered. “What are you doing? You have a human on\n",
      "your back! Have you no shame? Are you a common mule?\"\n",
      "\"Do you realize who this is?\" said Firenze. “This is the Potter boy. The\n",
      "quicker he leaves this forest, the better.\"\n",
      "\"What have you been telling him?\" growled Bane. \"Remember, Firenze,\n",
      "we are sworn not to set ourselves against the heavens. Have we not read what is\n",
      "to come in the movements of the planets?\"\n",
      "Ronan pawed the ground nervously. \"I'm sure Firenze thought he was\n",
      "acting for the best,\" he said in his gloomy voice.\n",
      "Bane kicked his back legs in anger.\n",
      "\"For the best! What is that to do with us? Centaurs are concerned with\n",
      "what has been foretold! It is not our business to run around like donkeys after\n",
      "stray humans in our forest!\"\n",
      "Firenze suddenly reared on to his hind legs in anger, so that Harry had to\n",
      "grab his shoulders to stay on.\n",
      "\"Do you not see that unicorn?” Firenze bellowed at Bane. “Do you not\n",
      "understand why it was killed? Or have the planets not let you in on that secret? I\n",
      "set myself against what is lurking in this forest, Bane, yes, with humans\n",
      "alongside me if I must.”\n",
      "And Firenze whisked around; with Harry clutching on as best he could,\n",
      "they plunged off into the trees, leaving Ronan and Bane behind them.\n",
      "Harry didn't have a clue what was going on.\n",
      "\"Why's Bane so angry?” he asked. “What was that thing you saved me\n",
      "from, anyway?\"\n",
      "Firenze slowed to a walk, warned Harry to keep his head bowed in case\n",
      "of low-hanging branches, but did not answer Harry's question. They made their\n",
      "way through the trees in silence for so long that Harry thought Firenze didn't\n",
      "want to talk to him anymore. They were passing through a particularly dense\n",
      "patch of trees, however, when Firenze suddenly stopped.\n",
      "\"Harry Potter, do you know what unicorn blood is used for?\"\n",
      "\"No,\" said Harry, startled by the odd question. \"We've only used the horn\n",
      "and tail hair in Potions.\"\n",
      "\"That is because it is a monstrous thing, to slay a unicorn,” said Firenze.\n",
      "\"Only one who has nothing to lose, and everything to gain, would commit such a\n",
      "crime. The blood of a unicorn will keep you alive, even if you are an inch from\n",
      "death, but at a terrible price. You have slain something pure and defenseless to\n",
      "save yourself, and you will have but a half-life, a cursed life, from the moment\n",
      "the blood touches your lips.\"\n",
      "Harry stared at the back of Firenze's head, which was dappled silver in\n",
      "the moonlight.\n",
      "\"But who'd be that desperate?\" he wondered aloud. \"If you're going to\n",
      "be cursed forever, death's better, isn't it?\"\n",
      "\"It is,\" Firenze agreed, \"unless all you need is to stay alive long enough\n",
      "to drink something else something that will bring you back to full strength\n",
      "something that will mean you can never die. Mr. Potter, do you\n",
      "and power\n",
      "know what is hidden in the school at this very moment?\"\n",
      "\"The Sorcerer's Stone! Of course the Elixir of Life! But I don't\n",
      "understand who —\"\n",
      "\"Can you think of nobody who has waited many years to return to power,\n",
      "who has clung to life, awaiting their chance?\"\n",
      "It was as though an iron fist had clenched suddenly around Harry's heart.\n",
      "Over the rustling of the trees, he seemed to hear once more what Hagrid had told\n",
      "him on the night they had met: \"Some say he died. Codswallop, in my opinion.\n",
      "Dunno if he had enough human left in him to die.”\n",
      "\"Do you mean,\" Harry croaked, \"that was Vol-\"\n",
      "\"Harry! Harry, are you all right?\"\n",
      "Hermione was running toward them down the path, Hagrid puffing along\n",
      "behind her.\n",
      "\"I'm fine,\" said Harry, hardly knowing what he was saying. \"The\n",
      "unicorn's dead, Hagrid, it's in that clearing back there.”\n",
      "\"This is where I leave you,\" Firenze murmured as Hagrid hurried off to\n",
      "examine the unicorn. \"You are safe now.\"\n",
      "Harry slid off his back.\n",
      "\"Good luck, Harry Potter,\" said Firenze. \"The planets have been read\n",
      "wrongly before now, even by centaurs. I hope this is one of those times.”\n",
      "He turned and cantered back into the depths of the forest, leaving Harry\n",
      "shivering behind him.\n",
      "Ron had fallen asleep in the dark common room, waiting for them to return.\n",
      "He shouted something about Quidditch fouls when Harry roughly shook him\n",
      "awake. In a matter of seconds, though, he was wide-eyed as Harry began to tell\n",
      "him and Hermione what had happened in the forest.\n",
      "Harry couldn't sit down. He paced up and down in front of the fire. He\n",
      "was still shaking.\n",
      "\"Snape wants the stone for Voldemort...and Voldemort's waiting in the\n",
      "forest...and all this time we thought Snape just wanted to get rich....”\n",
      "\"Stop saying the name!” said Ron in a terrified whisper, as if he thought\n",
      "Voldemort could hear them.\n",
      "Harry wasn't listening.\n",
      "\"Firenze saved me, but he shouldn't have done so....Bane was furious...\n",
      "he was talking about interfering with what the planets say is going to\n",
      "happen....They must show that Voldemort's coming back....Bane thinks Firenze\n",
      "should have let Voldemort kill me....I suppose that's written in the stars as well.\"\n",
      "\"Will you stop saying the name!\" Ron hissed.\n",
      "\"So all I've got to wait for now is Snape to steal the Stone,” Harry went\n",
      "on feverishly, \"then Voldemort will be able to come and finish me off ... Well, I\n",
      "suppose Bane'll be happy.\"\n",
      "Hermione looked very frightened, but she had a word of comfort.\n",
      "\"Harry, everyone says Dumbledore's the only one You-Know-Who was\n",
      "ever afraid of with Dumbledore around, You-Know-Who won't touch you.\n",
      "Anyway, who says the centaurs are right? It sounds like fortune-telling to me,\n",
      "and Professor McGonagall says that's a very imprecise branch of magic.\"\n",

      "exhausted, their throats sore. But the night's surprises weren't over.\n",

      "grounds toward the forest, didn't answer.\n",
      "Hagrid was sitting in an armchair outside his house; his trousers and\n",
      "sleeves were rolled up, and he was shelling peas into a large bowl.\n",
      "“Hullo,” he said, smiling. “Finished yer exams? Got time fer a drink?\"\n",
      "\"Yes, please,\" said Ron, but Harry cut him off.\n",
      "\"No, we're in a hurry. Hagrid, I've got to ask you something. You know\n",
      "that night you won Norbert? What did the stranger you were playing cards with\n",
      "look like?\"\n",
      "\"Dunno,\" said Hagrid casually, \"he wouldn' take his cloak off.\"\n",
      "He saw the three of them look stunned and raised his eyebrows.\n",
      "\"It's not that unusual, yeh get a lot o' funny folk in the Hog's Head\n",
      "that's the pub down in the village. Mighta bin a dragon dealer, mightn' he? I\n",
      "never saw his face, he kept his hood up.\"\n",
      "Harry sank down next to the bowl of peas. \"What did you talk to him\n",
      "about, Hagrid? Did you mention Hogwarts at all?\"\n",
      "\"Mighta come up,\" said Hagrid, frowning as he tried to remember.\n",
      "\"Yeah...he asked what I did, an' I told him I was gamekeeper here... He asked a\n",
      "bit about the sorta creatures I took after...so I told him...an' I said what I'd\n",
      "always really wanted was a dragon...an' then...I can' remember too well, 'cause\n",
      "he kept buyin' me drinks...Let's see...yeah, then he said he had the dragon egg\n",
      "an’ we could play cards fer it if I wanted…but he had ter be sure I could handle\n",
      "it, he didn’ want it ter go ter any old home....So I told him, after Fluffy, a dragon\n",
      "would be easy....\"\n",
      "did he seem interested in Fluffy?” Harry asked, trying to\n",
      "\"And did he\n",
      "keep his voice calm.\n",
      "\"Well - yeah how many three-headed dogs d'yeh meet, even around\n",
      "Hogwarts? So I told him, Fluffy's a piece o' cake if yeh know how to calm him\n",
      "down, jus' play him a bit o' music an' he'll go straight off ter sleep -\"\n",
      "Hagrid suddenly looked horrified.\n",
      "\"I shouldn'ta told yeh that!” he blurted out. \"Forget I said it! Hey\n",
      "where're yeh goin'?\"\n",
      "Harry, Ron, and Hermione didn't speak to each other at all until they\n",
      "came to a halt in the entrance hall, which seemed very cold and gloomy after the\n",
      "grounds.\n",
      "\"We've got to go to Dumbledore,” said Harry. “Hagrid told that stranger\n",
      "how to get past Fluffy, and it was either Snape or Voldemort under that cloak\n",
      "it must've been easy, once he'd got Hagrid drunk. I just hope Dumbledore\n",
      "believes us. Firenze might back us up if Bane doesn't stop him. Where's\n",
      "Dumbledore's office?\"\n",
      "They looked around, as if hoping to see a sign pointing them in the right\n",
      "direction. They had never been told where Dumbledore lived, nor did they know\n",
      "anyone who had been sent to see him.\n",
      "\"We'll just have to —\" Harry began, but a voice suddenly rang across the\n",
      "hall.\n",
      "\"What are you three doing inside?”\n",
      "It was Professor McGonagall, carrying a large pile of books.\n",
      "\"We want to see Professor Dumbledore,” said Hermione, rather bravely,\n",
      "Harry and Ron thought.\n",
      "\"See Professor Dumbledore?\" Professor McGonagall repeated, as though\n",
      "this was a very fishy thing to want to do. \"Why?\"\n",
      "Harry swallowed - now what?\n",
      "\"It's sort of secret,\" he said, but he wished at once he hadn't, because\n",
      "Professor McGonagall's nostrils flared.\n",
      "\"Professor Dumbledore left ten minutes ago,\" she said coldly. \"He\n",
      "received an urgent owl from the Ministry of Magic and flew off for London at\n",
      "once.\"\n",
      "\"He's gone?\" said Harry frantically. \"Now?\"\n",
      "\"Professor Dumbledore is a very great wizard, Potter, he has many\n",
      "demands on his time – ”\n",
      "\"But this is important.\"\n",
      "\"Something you have to say is more important than the Ministry of\n",
      "Magic, Potter?”\n",
      "\"Look,\" said Harry, throwing caution to the winds, \"Professor — it's\n",
      "about the Sorcerer's Stone\n",
      "Whatever Professor McGonagall had expected, it wasn't that. The books\n",
      "she was carrying tumbled out of her arms, but she didn't pick them up.\n",
      "\"How do you know?\" she spluttered.\n",
      "\"Professor, I think\n",
      "I know\n",
      "that Sn— that someone's going to try\n",
      "and steal the Stone. I've got to talk to Professor Dumbledore.\"\n",
      "She eyed him with a mixture of shock and suspicion.\n",
      "\"Professor Dumbledore will be back tomorrow,” she said finally. I don't\n",
      "know how you found out about the Stone, but rest assured, no one can possibly\n",
      "steal it, it's too well protected.\"\n",
      "\"\"\n",
      "\"But Professor\n",
      "\"Potter, I know what I'm talking about,\" she said shortly. She bent down\n",
      "and gathered up the fallen books. I suggest you all go back outside and enjoy the\n",
      "sunshine.\"\n",
      "But they didn't.\n",
      "\"It's tonight,\" said Harry, once he was sure Professor McGonagall was\n",
      "out of earshot. \"Snape's going through the trapdoor tonight. He's found out\n",
      "everything he needs, and now he's got Dumbledore out of the way. He sent that\n",
      "note, I bet the Ministry of Magic will get a real shock when Dumbledore turns\n",
      "up.\"\n",
      "smile.\n",
      "\"But what can we\n",
      "Hermione gasped. Harry and Ron wheeled round.\n",
      "Snape was standing there.\n",
      "\"Good afternoon,\" he said smoothly.\n",
      "They stared at him.\n",
      "\"You shouldn't be inside on a day like this,\" he said, with an odd, twisted\n",
      "\"We were Harry began, without any idea what he was going to say.\n",
      "\"You want to be more careful,” said Snape. “Hanging around like this,\n",
      "people will think you're up to something. And Gryffindor really can't afford to\n",
      "lose any more points, can it?\"\n",
      "Harry flushed. They turned to go outside, but Snape called them back.\n",
      "\"Be warned, Potter any more nighttime wanderings and I will\n",
      "personally make sure you are expelled. Good day to you.\"\n",
      "He strode off in the direction of the staffroom.\n",
      "Out on the stone steps, Harry turned to the others.\n",
      "\"Right, here's what we've got to do,\" he whispered urgently. \"One of us\n",
      "has got to keep an eye on Snape — wait outside the staff room and follow him if\n",
      "he leaves it. Hermione, you'd better do that.\"\n",
      "\"Why me?\"\n",
      "\"It's obvious,” said Ron. “You can pretend to be waiting for Professor\n",
      "Flitwick, you know.\" He put on a high voice, \"Oh Professor Flitwick, I'm so\n",
      "worried, I think I got question fourteen b wrong…...\n",
      "“Oh, shut up,” said Hermione, but she agreed to go and watch out for\n",
      "Snape.\n",
      "\"And we'd better stay outside the third-floor corridor,\" Harry told Ron.\n",
      "\"Come on.\"\n",
      "\"\"\n",
      "روو\n",
      "But that part of the plan didn't work. No sooner had they reached the\n",
      "door separating Fluffy from the rest of the school than Professor McGonagall\n",
      "turned up again and this time, she lost her temper.\n",
      "\"I suppose you think you're harder to get past than a pack of\n",
      "enchantments!\" she stormed. “Enough of this nonsense! If I hear you've come\n",
      "anywhere near here again, I'll take another fifty points from Gryffindor! Yes,\n",
      "Weasley, from my own house!\"\n",
      "Harry and Ron went back to the common room, Harry had just said, “At\n",
      "least Hermione's on Snape's tail,\" when the portrait of the Fat Lady swung open\n",
      "and Hermione came in.\n",
      "\"I'm sorry, Harry!\" she wailed. \"Snape came out and asked me what I\n",
      "was doing, so I said I was waiting for Flitwick, and Snape went to get him, and\n",
      "I've only just got away, I don't know where Snape went.\n",
      "\"Well, that's it then, isn't it?\" Harry said.\n",
      "first.\"\n",
      "The other two stared at him. He was pale and his eyes were glittering.\n",
      "\"I'm going out of here tonight and I'm going to try and get to the Stone\n",
      "\"You're mad!\" said Ron.\n",
      "\"You can't!\" said Hermione. \"After what McGonagall and Snape have\n",
      "said? You'll be expelled!\"\n",
      "\"SO WHAT\" Harry shouted. \"Don't you understand? If Snape gets hold\n",
      "of the Stone, Voldemort's coming back! Haven't you heard what it was like\n",
      "when he was trying to take over? There won't be any Hogwarts to get expelled\n",
      "from! He'll flatten it, or turn it into a school for the Dark Arts! Losing points\n",
      "doesn't matter anymore, can't you see? D’you think he'll leave you and your\n",
      "families alone if Gryffindor wins the house cup? If I get caught before I can get\n",
      "to the Stone, well, I'll have to go back to the Dursleys and wait for Voldemort to\n",
      "find me there, it's only dying a bit later than I would have, because I'm never\n",
      "going over to the Dark Side! I'm going through that trapdoor tonight and nothing\n",
      "you two say is going to stop me! Voldemort killed my parents, remember?\"\n",
      "He glared at them.\n",
      "\"You're right Harry,\" said Hermione in a small voice.\n",
      "\"I'll use the invisibility cloak,\" said Harry. \"It's just lucky I got it back.\"\n",
      "\"But will it cover all three of us?” said Ron.\n",
      "\"All — all three of us?\"\n",
      "\"Oh, come off it, you don't think we'd let\n",
      "you go alone?\"\n",
      "\"Of course not,\" said Hermione briskly. \"How do you think you'd get to\n",
      "the Stone without us? I'd better go and took through my books, there might be\n",
      "something useful....\"\n",
      "\"But if we get caught, you two will be expelled, too.\"\n",
      "\"Not if I can help it,” said Hermione grimly. “Flitwick told me in secret\n",
      "that I got a hundred and twelve percent on his exam. They're not throwing me\n",
      "out after that.”\n",
      "After dinner the three of them sat nervously apart in the common room.\n",
      "Nobody bothered them; none of the Gryffindors had anything to say to Harry\n",
      "any more, after all. This was the first night he hadn't been upset by it. Hermione\n",
      "was skimming through all her notes, hoping to come across one of the\n",
      "enchantments they were about to try to break. Harry and Ron didn't talk much.\n",
      "Both of them were thinking about what they were about to do.\n",
      "Slowly, the room emptied as people drifted off to bed.\n",
      "\"Better get the cloak,\" Ron muttered, as Lee Jordan finally left,\n",
      "stretching and yawning. Harry ran upstairs to their dark dormitory. He pulled out\n",
      "the cloak and then his eyes fell on the flute Hagrid had given him for Christmas.\n",
      "He pocketed it to use on Fluffy - he didn't feel much like singing.\n",
      "He ran back down to the common room.\n",
      "\"We'd better put the cloak on here, and make sure it covers all three of us\n",
      "– if Filch spots one of our feet wandering along on its own\n",
      "\"\"\n",
      "\"What are you doing?\" said a voice from the corner of the room. Neville\n",
      "appeared from behind an armchair, clutching Trevor the toad, who looked as\n",
      "though he'd been making another bid for freedom.\n",
      "\"Nothing, Neville, nothing,\" said Harry, hurriedly putting the cloak\n",
      "behind his back.\n",
      "Neville stared at their guilty faces.\n",
      "\"You're going out again,\" he said.\n",
      "“No, no, no,” said Hermione. “No, we're not. Why don't you go to bed,\n",
      "Neville?\"\n",
      "Harry looked at the grandfather clock by the door. They couldn't afford\n",
      "to waste any more time, Snape might even now be playing Fluffy to sleep.\n",
      "\"You can't go out,\" said Neville, \"you'll be caught again. Gryffindor will\n",
      "be in even more trouble.\"\n",
      "\"You don't understand,\" said Harry, \"this is important.\"\n",
      "But Neville was clearly steeling himself to do something desperate.\n",
      "I won't let you do it,” he said, hurrying to stand in front of the portrait\n",
      "I'll fight you!\"\n",
      "\"Neville, \"Ron exploded, “get away from that hole and don't be an idiot\n",
      "hole. \"I'll\n",
      "\"Don't you call me an idiot!” said Neville. I don't think you should be\n",
      "breaking any more rules! And you were the one who told me to stand up to\n",
      "people!\"\n",
      "\"Yes, but not to us,\" said Ron in exasperation. \"Neville, you don't know\n",
      "what you're doing.\"\n",
      "He took a step forward and Neville dropped Trevor the toad, who leapt\n",
      "out of sight.\n",
      "\"Go on then, try and hit me!\" said Neville, raising his fists. \"I'm ready!\"\n",
      "Harry turned to Hermione.\n",
      "\"Do something,\" he said desperately.\n",
      "Hermione stepped forward.\n",
      "\"Neville,\" she said, \"I'm really, really sorry about this.\"\n",
      "She raised her wand.\n",
      "\"Petrificus Totalus!\" she cried, pointing it at Neville.\n",
      "Neville's arms snapped to his sides. His legs sprang together. His whole\n",
      "body rigid, he swayed where he stood and then fell flat on his face, stiff as a\n",
      "board.\n",
      "sorry.\"\n",
      "Hermione ran to turn him over. Neville's jaws were jammed together so\n",
      "he couldn't speak. Only his eyes were moving, looking at them in horror.\n",
      "\"What've you done to him?\" Harry whispered.\n",
      "\"It's the full Body-Bind,” said Hermione miserably. “Oh, Neville, I'm so\n",
      "\"We had to, Neville, no time to explain,” said Harry.\n",
      "\"You'll understand later, Neville,” said Ron as they stepped over him and\n",
      "pulled on the invisibility cloak.\n",
      "But leaving Neville lying motionless on the floor didn't feel like a very\n",
      "good omen. In their nervous state, every statue's shadow looked like Filch, every\n",
      "distant breath of wind sounded like Peeves swooping down on them. At the foot\n",
      "of the first set of stairs, they spotted Mrs. Norris skulking near the top.\n",
      "\"Oh, let's kick her, just this once,\" Ron whispered in Harry's ear, but\n",
      "Harry shook his head. As they climbed carefully around her, Mrs. Norris turned\n",
      "her lamplike eyes on them, but didn't do anything.\n",
      "They didn't meet anyone else until they reached the staircase up to the\n",
      "third floor. Peeves was bobbing halfway up, loosening the carpet so that people\n",
      "would trip.\n",
      "\"Who's there?\" he said suddenly as they climbed toward him. He\n",
      "narrowed his wicked black eyes. “Know you're there, even if I can't see you.\n",
      "Are you ghoulie or ghostie or wee student beastie?”\n",
      "He rose up in the air and floated there, squinting at them.\n",
      "\"Should call Filch, I should, if something's a-creeping around unseen.\"\n",
      "Harry had a sudden idea.\n",
      "\"Peeves,\" he said, in a hoarse whisper, \"the Bloody Baron has his own\n",
      "reasons for being invisible.\"\n",
      "Peeves almost fell out of the air in shock. He caught himself in time and\n",
      "hovered about a foot off the stairs.\n",
      "\"So sorry, your bloodiness, Mr. Baron, Sir,\" he said greasily. \"My\n",
      "of course I didn't, you're invisible\n",
      "mistake, my mistake – I didn't see you\n",
      "forgive old Peevsie his little joke, sir.\"\n",
      "\"I have business here, Peeves,\" croaked Harry. \"Stay away from this\n",
      "place tonight.\"\n",
      "\"I will, sir, I most certainly will,\" said Peeves, rising up in the air again.\n",
      "\"Hope your business goes well, Baron, I'll not bother you.\"\n",
      "And he scooted off.\n",
      "\"Brilliant, Harry!\" whispered Ron.\n",
      "A few seconds later, they were there, outside the third-floor corridor\n",
      "and the door was already ajar.\n",
      "\"Well, there you are,\" Harry said quietly, \"Snape's already got past\n",
      "Fluffy.\"\n",
      "Seeing the open door somehow seemed to impress upon all three of them\n",
      "what was facing them. Underneath the cloak, Harry turned to the other two.\n",
      "\"If you want to go back, I won't blame you,\" he said. \"You can take the\n",
      "cloak, I won't need it now.”\n",
      "\"Don't be stupid,\" said Ron.\n",
      "\"We're coming,\" said Hermione.\n",
      "Harry pushed the door open.\n",
      "As the door creaked, low, rumbling growls met their ears. All three of the\n",
      "dog's noses sniffed madly in their direction, even though it couldn't see them.\n",
      "\"What's that at its feet?\" Hermione whispered.\n",
      "\"Looks like a harp,\" said Ron. \"Snape must have left it there.\"\n",
      "\"It must wake up the moment you stop playing,\" said Harry. \"Well, here\n",
      "\"9\n",
      "goes ...\n",
      "He put Hagrid's flute to his lips and blew. It wasn't really a tune, but\n",
      "from the first note the beast's eyes began to droop. Harry hardly drew breath.\n",
      "Slowly, the dog's growls ceased — it tottered on its paws and fell to its knees,\n",
      "then it slumped to the ground, fast asleep.\n",
      "\"Keep playing,\" Ron warned Harry as they slipped out of the cloak and\n",
      "crept toward the trapdoor. They could feel the dog's hot, smelly breath as they\n",
      "approached the giant heads. \"I think we'll be able to pull the door open,\" said\n",
      "Ron, peering over the dog's back. \"Want to go first, Hermione?\"\n",
      "\"No, I don't!\"\n",
      "\"All right.\" Ron gritted his teeth and stepped carefully over the dog's\n",
      "legs. He bent and pulled the ring of the trapdoor, which swung up and open.\n",
      "\"What can you see?\" Hermione said anxiously.\n",
      "\"Nothing - just black - there's no way of climbing down, we'll just\n",
      "have to drop.\"\n",
      "Harry, who was still playing the flute, waved at Ron to get his attention\n",
      "and pointed at himself.\n",
      "\"You want to go first? Are you sure?” said Ron. “I don't know how deep\n",
      "this thing goes. Give the flute to Hermione so she can keep him asleep.\"\n",
      "Harry handed the flute over. In the few seconds' silence, the dog growled\n",
      "and twitched, but the moment Hermione began to play, it fell back into its deep\n",
      "sleep.\n",
      "Harry climbed over it and looked down through the trapdoor. There was\n",
      "no sign of the bottom.\n",
      "He lowered himself through the hole until he was hanging on by his\n",
      "fingertips. Then he looked up at Ron and said, \"If anything happens to me, don't\n",
      "follow. Go straight to the owlery and send Hedwig to Dumbledore, right?\"\n",
      "\"Right,\" said Ron.\n",
      "\"See you in a minute, I hope ...'\n",
      "And Harry let go. Cold, damp air rushed past him as he fell down, down,\n",
      "down and\n",
      "FLUMP. With a funny, muffled sort of thump he landed on something\n",
      "soft. He sat up and felt around, his eyes not used to the gloom. It felt as though\n",
      "he was sitting on some sort of plant.\n",
      "\"It's okay!\" he called up to the light the size of a postage stamp, which\n",
      "was the open trapdoor, \"it's a soft landing, you can jump!\"\n",
      "Ron followed right away. He landed, sprawled next to Harry.\n",
      "\"What's this stuff?\" were his first words.\n",
      "\"Dunno, some sort of plant thing. I suppose it's here to break the fall.\n",
      "Come on, Hermione!”\n",
      "The distant music stopped. There was a loud bark from the dog, but\n",
      "Hermione had already jumped. She landed on Harry's other side.\n",
      "\"We must be miles under the school,\" she said.\n",
      "\"Lucky this plant thing's here, really,\" said Ron.\n",
      "\"Lucky!\" shrieked Hermione. “Look at you both!\"\n",
      "She leapt up and struggled toward a damp wall. She had to struggle\n",
      "because the moment she had landed, the plant had started to twist snakelike\n",
      "tendrils around her ankles. As for Harry and Ron, their legs had already been\n",
      "bound tightly in long creepers without their noticing.\n",
      "Hermione had managed to free herself before the plant got a firm grip on\n",
      "her. Now she watched in horror as the two boys fought to pull the plant off them,\n",
      "but the more they strained against it, the tighter and faster the plant wound\n",
      "around them.\n",
      "\"Stop moving!\" Hermione ordered them. \"I know what this is\n",
      "Devil's Snare!\"\n",
      "\"Oh, I'm so glad we know what it's called, that's a great help,\" snarled\n",
      "Ron, leaning back, trying to stop the plant from curling around his neck. \"Shut\n",
      "up, I'm trying to remember how to kill it!\" said Hermione.\n",
      "\"Well, hurry up, I can't breathe!\" Harry gasped, wrestling with it as it\n",
      "curled around his chest.\n",
      "hands.\n",
      "—\n",
      "\"Devil's Snare, Devil's Snare...what did Professor Sprout say?- it likes\n",
      "the dark and the damp.\"\n",
      "\"So light a fire!\" Harry choked.\n",
      "\"Yes- of course but there's no wood!\" Hermione cried, wringing her\n",
      "NOT?\"\n",
      "- it's\n",
      "ahead.\n",

      "cupboard, he came up with a strange vision: a blinding flash of green light and a\n",
      "burning pain on his forehead. This, he supposed, was the crash, though he\n",

      "There was a horrible smell in the kitchen the next morning when Harry went\n",

      "went to have a look. The tub was full of what looked like dirty rags swimming in\n",
      "gray water.\n",
      "\"What's this?\" he asked Aunt Petunia. Her lips tightened as they always\n",

      "band. No one, ever, in his whole life, had written to him. Who would? He had no\n",
      "friends, no other relatives he didn't belong to the library, so he'd never even\n",

      "\"Hurry up, boy!\" shouted Uncle Vernon from the kitchen. “What are you\n",
      "doing, checking for letter bombs?\" He chuckled at his own joke.\n",
      "Harry went back to the kitchen, still staring at his letter. He handed Uncle\n",

      "Harry was on the point of unfolding his letter, which was written on the\n",

      "hand by Uncle Vernon.\n",
      "\"That's mine!\" said Harry, trying to snatch it back.\n",
      "\"Who'd be writing to you?\" sneered Uncle Vernon, shaking the letter\n",
      "open with one hand and glancing at it. His face went from red to green faster\n",
      "than a set of traffic lights. And it didn't stop there. Within seconds it was the\n",

      "\"P-P-Petunia!\" he gasped.\n",

      "\"Vernon! Oh my goodness - Vernon!\"\n",
      "They stared at each other, seeming to have forgotten that Harry and\n",
      "Dudley were still in the room. Dudley wasn't used to being ignored. He gave his\n",

      "\"I want to read that letter,” he said loudly.\n",
      "\"I want to read it,\" said Harry furiously, \"as it's mine.\"\n",

      "“Let me see it!” demanded Dudley.\n",
      "\"OUT!\" roared Uncle Vernon, and he took both Harry and Dudley by the\n",
      "scruffs of their necks and threw them into the hall, slamming the kitchen door\n",
      "behind them. Harry and Dudley promptly had a furious but silent fight over who\n",

      "second, but nothing happened. He reached the door untouched. He pulled the\n",
      "handle, but it was locked.\n",
      "The other two followed him. They tugged and heaved at the door, but it\n",
      "wouldn't budge, not even when Hermione tried her Alohomora charm.\n",
      "\"Now what?” said Ron.\n",
      "\"These birds...they can't be here just for decoration,” said Hermione.\n",
      "They watched the birds soaring overhead, glittering — glittering?\n",
      "\"They're not birds!\" Harry said suddenly. \"They're keys! Winged keys\n",

      "other two squinted up at the flock of keys. \"...yes look! Broomsticks! We've\n",

      "\"But there are hundreds of them!\"\n",
      "Ron examined the lock on the door.\n",
      "\"We're looking for a big, old-fashioned one — probably silver, like the\n",
      "handle.\"\n",
      "They each seized a broomstick and kicked off into the air, soaring into\n",
      "the midst of the cloud of keys. They grabbed and snatched, but the bewitched\n",
      "keys darted and dived so quickly it was almost impossible to catch one.\n",
      "Not for nothing, though, was Harry the youngest Seeker in a century. He\n",
      "had a knack for spotting things other people didn't. After a minute's weaving\n",
      "about through the whirl of rainbow feathers, he noticed a large silver key that\n",
      "had a bent wing, as if it had already been caught and stuffed roughly into the\n",
      "keyhole.\n",
      "\"That one!\" he called to the others. \"That big one there no, there\n",
      "- with bright blue wings - the feathers are all crumpled on one side.\"\n",
      "Ron went speeding in the direction that Harry was pointing, crashed into\n",
      "the ceiling, and nearly fell off his broom.\n",
      "\"We've got to close in on it!\" Harry called, not taking his eyes off the key\n",
      "with the damaged wing. \"Ron, you come at it from above - Hermione, stay\n",
      "below and stop it from going down and I'll try and catch it. Right, NOW!\"\n",
      "Ron dived, Hermione rocketed upward, the key dodged them both, and\n",
      "Harry streaked after it; it sped toward the wall, Harry leaned forward and with a\n",
      "nasty, crunching noise, pinned it against the stone with one hand. Ron and\n",
      "Hermione's cheers echoed around the high chamber.\n",
      "They landed quickly, and Harry ran to the door, the key struggling in his\n",
      "hand. He rammed it into the lock and turned – it worked. The moment the lock\n",
      "had clicked open, the key took flight again, looking very battered now that it had\n",
      "been caught twice.\n",
      "\"Ready?\" Harry asked the other two, his hand on the door handle. They\n",
      "nodded. He pulled the door open.\n",
      "The next chamber was so dark they couldn't see anything at all. But as\n",
      "they stepped into it, light suddenly flooded the room to reveal an astonishing\n",
      "sight.\n",
      "They were standing on the edge of a huge chessboard, behind the black.\n",
      "chessmen, which were all taller than they were and carved from what looked like\n",
      "black stone. Facing them, way across the chamber, were the white pieces. Harry,\n",
      "Ron and Hermione shivered slightly – the towering white chessmen had no\n",
      "faces.\n",
      "room.\"\n",
      "\"Now what do we do?\" Harry whispered.\n",
      "\"It's obvious, isn't it?” said Ron. \"We've got to play our way across the\n",

      "\"How?\" said Hermione nervously.\n",
      "\"I think,\" said Ron, \"we're going to have to be chessmen.\"\n",
      "He walked up to a black knight and put his hand out to touch the knight's\n",
      "horse. At once, the stone sprang to life. The horse pawed the ground and the\n",
      "knight turned his helmeted head to look down at Ron.\n",
      "\"Do we\n",
      "er have to join you to get across?” The black knight\n",
      "nodded. Ron turned to the other two.\n",
      "\"This needs thinking about...\" he said. \"I suppose we've got to take the\n",
      "place of three of the black pieces....\"\n",
      "Harry and Hermione stayed quiet, watching Ron think. Finally he said,\n",
      "\"Now, don't be offended or anything, but neither of you are that good at chess\n",
      "\"We're not offended,” said Harry quickly. “Just tell us what to do.\"\n",
      "\"Well, Harry, you take the place of that bishop, and Hermione, you next\n",
      "to him instead of that castle.\"\n",
      "\"What about you?\"\n",
      "“I'm going to be a knight,” said Ron.\n",
      "The chessmen seemed to have been listening, because at these words a\n",
      "knight, a bishop, and a castle turned their backs on the white pieces and walked\n",
      "off the board, leaving three empty squares that Harry, Ron, and Hermione took.\n",
      "\"White always plays first in chess,\" said Ron, peering across the board.\n",
      "\"Yes...look...”\n",
      "A white pawn had moved forward two squares.\n",
      "Ron started to direct the black pieces. They moved silently wherever he\n",
      "sent them. Harry's knees were trembling. What if they lost?\n",
      "\"Harry - move diagonally four squares to the right.\"\n",
      "Their first real shock came when their other knight was taken. The white\n",
      "queen smashed him to the floor and dragged him off the board, where he lay\n",
      "quite still, facedown.\n",
      "“Had to let that happen,” said Ron, looking shaken. “Leaves you free to\n",
      "take that bishop, Hermione, go on.\"\n",
      "Every time one of their men was lost, the white pieces showed no mercy.\n",
      "Soon there was a huddle of limp black players slumped along the wall. Twice,\n",
      "Ron only just noticed in time that Harry and Hermione were in danger. He\n",
      "himself darted around the board, taking almost as many white pieces as they had\n",
      "lost black ones.\n",
      "\"We're nearly there,\" he muttered suddenly. \"Let me think — let me\n",
      "think…..”\n",
      "The white queen turned her blank face toward him.\n",
      "\"Yes...\" said Ron softly, \"It's the only way...I've got to be taken.\"\n",
      "\"NO!\" Harry and Hermione shouted.\n",
      "“That's chess!” snapped Ron. “You've got to make some sacrifices! I\n",
      "take one step forward and she'll take me that leaves you free to checkmate\n",
      "the king, Harry!\"\n",
      "\"But\n",
      "\"Do you want to stop Snape or not?”\n",
      "\"Ron -\"\n",
      "\"Look, if you don't hurry up, he'll already have the Stone!\"\n",
      "There was no alternative.\n",
      "\"Ready?\" Ron called, his face pale but determined. \"Here I go\n",
      "now,\n",
      "don't hang around once you've won.\"\n",
      "He stepped forward, and the white queen pounced. She struck Ron hard\n",
      "across the head with her stone arm, and he crashed to the floor Hermione\n",
      "screamed but stayed on her square the white queen dragged Ron to one side.\n",
      "He looked as if he'd been knocked out.\n",
      "Shaking, Harry moved three spaces to the left.\n",
      "The white king took off his crown and threw it at Harry's feet. They had\n",
      "won. The chessmen parted and bowed, leaving the door ahead clear. With one\n",
      "last desperate look back at Ron, Harry and Hermione charged through the door\n",
      "and up the next passageway.\n",
      "\"What if he's —?\"\n",
      "\"He'll be all right,\" said Harry, trying to convince himself. \"What do you\n",
      "reckon's next?”\n",
      "\"We've had Sprout's, that was the Devil's Snare; Flitwick must've put\n",
      "charms on the keys; McGonagall transfigured the chessmen to make them alive;\n",
      "that leaves Quirrell's spell, and Snape's.\"\n",
      "They had reached another door.\n",
      "\"All right?\" Harry whispered.\n",
      "\"Go on.\"\n",
      "Harry pushed it open.\n",
      "A disgusting smell filled their nostrils, making both of them pull their\n",
      "robes up over their noses. Eyes watering, they saw, flat on the floor in front of\n",
      "them, a troll even larger than the one they had tackled, out cold with a bloody\n",
      "lump on its head.\n",
      "\"I'm glad we didn't have to fight that one,\" Harry whispered as they\n",
      "stepped carefully over one of its massive legs. \"Come on, I can't breathe.\"\n",
      "He pulled open the next door, both of them hardly daring to look at what\n",
      "came next - but there was nothing very frightening in here, just a table with\n",
      "seven differently shaped bottles standing on it in a line.\n",
      "\"Snape's,\" said Harry. \"What do we have to do?\"\n",
      "They stepped over the threshold, and immediately a fire sprang up behind\n",
      "them in the doorway. It wasn't ordinary fire either; it was purple. At the same\n",
      "instant, black flames shot up in the doorway leading onward. They were trapped.\n",
      "\"Look!\" Hermione seized a roll of paper lying next to the bottles. Harry\n",
      "looked over her shoulder to read it:\n",
      "Danger lies before you, while safety lies behind,\n",
      "Two of us will help you, which ever you would find,\n",
      "One among us seven will let you move ahead,\n",
      "Another will transport the drinker back instead,\n",
      "Two among our number hold only nettle wine,\n",
      "Three of us are killers, waiting bidden in line.\n",
      "Choose, unless you wish to stay here forevermore,\n",
      "To help you in your choice, we give you these clues four:\n",
      "First, however slyly the poison tries to hide\n",
      "You will always find some on nettle wine's left side;\n",
      "Second, different are those who stand at either end,\n",
      "But if you would move onward, neither is your friend;\n",
      "Third, as you see clearly, all are different size,\n",
      "Neither dwarf nor giant holds death in their insides;\n",
      "Fourth, the second left and the second on the right\n",
      "Are twins once you taste them, though different at first sight.\n",
      "Hermione let out a great sigh and Harry, amazed, saw that she was smiling,\n",
      "the very last thing he felt like doing.\n",
      "\"Brilliant,\" said Hermione. \"This isn't magic — it's logic - a puzzle. A\n",
      "lot of the greatest wizards haven't got an ounce of logic, they'd be stuck in here\n",
      "forever.\"\n",
      "\"But so will we, won't we?\"\n",
      "\"Of course not,” said Hermione. “Everything we need is here on this\n",
      "paper. Seven bottles: three are poison; two are wine; one will get us safely\n",
      "through the black fire, and one will get us back through the purple.\"\n",
      "\"But how do we know which to drink?\"\n",
      "\"Give me a minute.”\n",
      "Hermione read the paper several times. Then she walked up and down\n",
      "the line of bottles, muttering to herself and pointing at them. At last, she clapped\n",
      "her hands.\n",
      "\"Got it,\" she said. “The smallest bottle will get us through the black\n",
      "fire\n",
      "toward the Stone.\"\n",
      "Harry looked at the tiny bottle.\n",
      "\"There's only enough there for one of us,\" he said. \"That's hardly one\n",
      "swallow.\"\n",
      "They looked at each other.\n",
      "\"Which one will get you back through the purple flames?\"\n",
      "Hermione pointed at a rounded bottle at the right end of the line.\n",
      "\"You drink that,” said Harry. “No, listen, get back and get Ron. Grab\n",
      "brooms from the flying-key room, they'll get you out of the trapdoor and past\n",
      "Fluffy go straight to the owlery and send Hedwig to Dumbledore, we need\n",
      "him. I might be able to hold Snape off for a while, but I'm no match for him,\n",
      "really.\"\n",
      "\"But Harry - what if You-Know-Who's with him?\"\n",
      "\"Well I was lucky once, wasn't I?” said Harry, pointing at his scar. “I\n",
      "might get lucky again.\"\n",
      "Hermione's lip trembled, and she suddenly dashed at Harry and threw her\n",
      "arms around him.\n",
      "\"Hermione!\"\n",
      "\"Harry you're a great wizard, you know.\"\n",
      "-\n",
      "him.\n",
      "\"I'm not as good as you,” said Harry, very embarrassed, as she let go of\n",
      "\"Me!\" said Hermione. “Books! And cleverness! There are more\n",
      "friendship and bravery and- oh Harry - be careful!\"\n",
      "\"You drink first,\" said Harry. \"You are sure which is which, aren't you?\"\n",
      "\"Positive,\" said Hermione. She took a long drink from the round bottle at\n",
      "important things\n",
      "the end, and shuddered.\n",
      "\"It's not poison?\" said Harry anxiously.\n",
      "\"No\n",
      "but it's like ice.\"\n",
      "\"Quick, go, before it wears off.\"\n",
      "\"Good luck take care.\"\n",
      "\"GO!\"\n",
      "Hermione turned and walked straight through the purple fire.\n",
      "Harry took a deep breath and picked up the smallest bottle. He turned to\n",
      "face the black flames.\n",
      "\"Here I come,\" he said, and he drained the little bottle in one gulp.\n",
      "It was indeed as though ice was flooding his body. He put the bottle\n",
      "down and walked forward; he braced himself, saw the black flames licking his\n",
      "body, but couldn't feel them for a moment he could see nothing but dark fire\n",
      "then he was on the other side, in the last chamber.\n",
      "There was already someone there but it wasn't Snape. It wasn't even\n",
      "Voldemort.\n",
      "HP 1 - Harry Potter and the\n",
      "Sorcerer's Stone\n",
      "THE MAN WITH TWO FACES\n",
      "It was Quirrell.\n",
      "CHAPTER SEVENTEEN\n",
      "\"You!\" gasped Harry.\n",
      "Quirrell smiled. His face wasn't twitching at all.\n",
      "\"Me,\" he said calmly. \"I wondered whether I'd be meeting you here,\n",
      "Potter.\"\n",
      "\"But I thought - Snape -\"\n",
      "\"Severus?\" Quirrell laughed, and it wasn't his usual quivering treble,\n",
      "either, but cold and sharp. \"Yes, Severus does seem the type, doesn't he? So\n",
      "useful to have him swooping around like an overgrown bat. Next to him, who\n",
      "would suspect p-p-poor, st-stuttering P-Professor Quirrell?\"\n",
      "Harry couldn't take it in. This couldn't be true, it couldn't.\n",
      "\"But Snape tried to kill me!\"\n",
      "\"No, no, no. I tried to kill you. Your friend Miss Granger accidentally\n",
      "knocked me over as she rushed to set fire to Snape at that Quidditch match. She\n",
      "broke my eye contact with you. Another few seconds and I'd have got you off\n",
      "that broom. I'd have managed it before then if Snape hadn't been muttering a\n",
      "countercurse, trying to save you.\"\n",
      "\"Snape was trying to save me?\"\n",
      "\"Of course,\" said Quirrell coolly. \"Why do you think he wanted to\n",
      "referee your next match? He was trying to make sure I didn't do it again. Funny,\n",
      "really...he needn't have bothered. I couldn't do anything with Dumbledore\n",
      "watching. All the other teachers thought Snape was trying to stop Gryffindor\n",
      "from winning, he did make himself unpopular...and what a waste of time, when\n",
      "after all that, I'm going to kill you tonight.\"\n",
      "Quirrell snapped his fingers. Ropes sprang out of thin air and wrapped\n",
      "themselves tightly around Harry.\n",
      "\"You're too nosy to live, Potter. Scurrying around the school on\n",
      "Halloween like that, for all I knew you'd seen me coming to look at what was\n",
      "guarding the Stone.\"\n",
      "\"You let the troll in?\"\n",
      "\"Certainly. I have a special gift with trolls - you must have seen what I\n",
      "did to the one in the chamber back there? Unfortunately, while everyone else\n",
      "was running around looking for it, Snape, who already suspected me, went\n",
      "straight to the third floor to head me off and not only did my troll fail to beat\n",
      "you to death, that three-headed dog didn't even manage to bite Snape's leg off\n",
      "properly.\n",
      "\"Now, wait quietly, Potter. I need to examine this interesting mirror.\"\n",
      "It was only then that Harry realized what was standing behind Quirrell. It\n",
      "was the Mirror of Erised.\n",
      "\"This mirror is the key to finding the Stone,\" Quirrell murmured, tapping\n",
      "his way around the frame. “Trust Dumbledore to come up with something like\n",
      "this...but he's in London...I'll be far away by the time he gets back...”\n",
      "All Harry could think of doing was to keep Quirrell talking and stop him\n",
      "from concentrating on the mirror.\n",
      "\"I saw you and Snape in the forest —” he blurted out.\n",
      "\"Yes,\" said Quirrell idly, walking around the mirror to look at the back.\n",
      "\"He was on to me by that time, trying to find out how far I'd got. He suspected\n",
      "me all along. Tried to frighten me as though he could, when I had Lord\n",
      "Voldemort on my side…….”\n",
      "Quirrell came back out from behind the mirror and stared hungrily into it.\n",
      "“I see the Stone…I'm presenting it to my master...but where is it?”\n",
      "Harry struggled against the ropes binding him, but they didn't give. He\n",
      "had to keep Quirrell from giving his whole attention to the mirror.\n",
      "\"But Snape always seemed to hate me so much.\"\n",
      "\"Oh, he does,\" said Quirrell casually, \"heavens, yes. He was at Hogwarts\n",
      "with your father, didn't you know? They loathed each other. But he never\n",
      "wanted you dead.\"\n",
      "\"But I heard you a few days ago, sobbing I thought Snape was\n",
      "threatening you....\"\n",
      "For the first time, a spasm of fear flitted across Quirrell's face.\n",
      "“Sometimes,” he said, “I find it hard to follow my master's instructions\n",
      "he is a great wizard and I am weak —\"\n",
      "\"You mean he was there in the classroom with you?\" Harry gasped.\n",
      "\"He is with me wherever I go,\" said Quirrell quietly. “I met him when I\n",
      "traveled around the world. A foolish young man I was then, full of ridiculous\n",
      "ideas about good and evil. Lord Voldemort showed me how wrong I was. There\n",
      "is no good and evil, there is only power, and those too weak to seek it...Since\n",
      "then, I have served him faithfully, although I have let him down many times. He\n",
      "has had to be very hard on me.\" Quirrell shivered suddenly. \"He does not forgive\n",
      "mistakes easily. When I failed to steal the stone from Gringotts, he was most\n",
      "displeased. He punished me...decided he would have to keep a closer watch on\n",
      "me…..”\n",
      "Alley\n",
      "Quirrell's voice trailed away. Harry was remembering his trip to Diagon\n",
      "how could he have been so stupid? He'd seen Quirrell there that very\n",
      "day, shaken hands with him in the Leaky Cauldron.\n",
      "Quirrell cursed under his breath.\n",

      "Harry's mind was racing.\n",
      "What I want more than anything else in the world at the moment, he\n",
      "thought, is to find the Stone before Quirrell does. So if I look in the mirror, I\n",
      "should see myself finding it which means I'll see where it's hidden! But how\n",

      "He tried to edge to the left, to get in front of the glass without Quirrell\n",
      "noticing, but the ropes around his ankles were too tight: he tripped and fell over.\n",
      "Quirrell ignored him. He was still talking to himself.\n",
      "\"What does this mirror do? How does it work? Help me, Master!”\n",

      "the mirror, and opened them again.\n",
      "He saw his reflection, pale and scared-looking at first. But a moment\n",
      "later, the reflection smiled at him. It put its hand into its pocket and pulled out a\n",
      "blood-red stone. It winked and put the Stone back in its pocket - and as it did\n",
      "so, Harry felt something heavy drop into his real pocket. Somehow - incredibly\n",
      "he'd gotten the Stone.\n",
      "\"Well?\" said Quirrell impatiently. \"What do you see?\"\n",

      "should have been a back to Quirrell's head, there was a face, the most terrible\n",
      "face Harry had ever seen. It was chalk white with glaring red eyes and slits for\n",
      "nostrils, like a snake.\n",
      "\"Harry Potter...\" it whispered.\n",

      "mercy...\"\n",
      "\"LIAR!\" Harry shouted suddenly.\n",
      "Quirrell was walking backward at him, so that Voldemort could still see\n",

      "once, a needle-sharp pain seared across Harry's scar; his head felt as though it\n",
      "was about to split in two; he yelled, struggling with all his might, and to his\n",
      "surprise, Quirrell let go of him. The pain in his head lessened he looked\n",
      "around wildly to see where Quirrell had gone, and saw him hunched in pain,\n",
      "looking at his fingers - they were blistering before his eyes.\n",
      "\"Seize him! SEIZE HIM!\" shrieked Voldemort again, and Quirrell\n",
      "lunged, knocking Harry clean off his feet landing on top of him, both hands\n",
      "around Harry's neck Harry's scar was almost blinding him with pain, yet he\n",

      "Quirrell couldn't touch his bare skin, not without suffering terrible pain - his\n",
      "only chance was to keep hold of Quirrell, keep him in enough pain to stop him\n",
      "from doing a curse.\n",
      "Harry jumped to his feet, caught Quirrell by the arm, and hung on as tight\n",
      "as he could. Quirrell screamed and tried to throw Harry off the pain in\n",
      "Harry's head was building — he couldn't see he could only hear Quirrell's\n",
      "terrible shrieks and Voldemort's yells of, \"KILL HIM! KILL HIM!\" and other\n",
      "voices, maybe in Harry's own head, crying, \"Harry! Harry!\"\n",
      "He felt Quirrell's arm wrenched from his grasp, knew all was lost, and\n",
      "fell into blackness, down...down... down....\n",
      "Something gold was glinting just above him. The Snitch! He tried to catch it,\n",
      "but his arms were too heavy.\n",
      "He blinked. It wasn't the Snitch at all. It was a pair of glasses. How\n",
      "strange.\n",
      "He blinked again. The smiling face of Albus Dumbledore swam into\n",
      "view above him.\n",
      "\"Good afternoon, Harry,\" said Dumbledore.\n",
      "Harry stared at him. Then he remembered: \"Sir! The Stone! It was\n",

      "\"Then who does? Sir, I -\"\n",
      "\"Harry, please relax, or Madam Pomfrey will have me thrown out.\"\n",
      "Harry swallowed and looked around him. He realized he must be in the\n",
      "hospital wing. He was lying in a bed with white linen sheets, and next to him\n",
      "was a table piled high with what looked like half the candy shop.\n",
      "\"Tokens from your friends and admirers,” said Dumbledore, beaming.\n",
      "\"What happened down in the dungeons between you and Professor Quirrell is a\n",
      "complete secret, so, naturally, the whole school knows. I believe your friends.\n",
      "Misters Fred and George Weasley were responsible for trying to send you a toilet\n",
      "seat. No doubt they thought it would amuse you. Madam Pomfrey, however, felt\n",
      "it might not be very hygienic, and confiscated it.\"\n",
      "\"How long have I been in here?\"\n",
      "\"Three days. Mr. Ronald Weasley and Miss Granger will be most\n",
      "relieved you have come round, they have been extremely worried.\"\n",
      "\"But sir, the Stone —\"\n",
      "\"I see you are not to be distracted. Very well, the Stone. Professor\n",
      "Quirrell did not manage to take it from you. I arrived in time to prevent that,\n",
      "although you were doing very well on your own, I must say.\"\n",
      "\"You got there? You got Hermione's owl?\"\n",
      "\"We must have crossed in midair. No sooner had I reached London than\n",
      "it became clear to me that the place I should be was the one I had just left. I\n",
      "arrived just in time to pull Quirrell off you.\"\n",
      "\"It was you.\"\n",
      "“I feared I might be too late.”\n",
      "\"You nearly were, I couldn't have kept him off the Stone much longer –”\n",
      "\"Not the Stone, boy, you - the effort involved nearly killed you. For one\n",
      "terrible moment there, I was afraid it had. As for the Stone, it has been\n",
      "destroyed.\"\n",
      "\"Destroyed?\" said Harry blankly. \"But your friend - Nicolas Flamel ->\n",
      "\"Oh, you know about Nicolas?\" said Dumbledore, sounding quite\n",
      "delighted. \"You did do the thing properly, didn't you? Well, Nicolas and I have\n",
      "had a little chat, and agreed it's all for the best.\"\n",
      "\"But that means he and his wife will die, won't they?\"\n",
      "\"They have enough Elixir stored to set their affairs in order and then, yes,\n",
      "they will die.\"\n",
      "Dumbledore smiled at the look of amazement on Harry's face.\n",
      "\"To one as young as you, I'm sure it seems incredible, but to Nicolas and\n",
      "Perenelle, it really is like going to bed after a very, very long day. After all, to the\n",
      "well-organized mind, death is but the next great adventure. You know, the Stone\n",
      "was really not such a wonderful thing. As much money and life as you could\n",
      "want! The two things most human beings would choose above all the trouble\n",
      "is, humans do have a knack of choosing precisely those things that are worst for\n",
      "them.\"\n",
      "-\n",
      "Harry lay there, lost for words. Dumbledore hummed a little and smiled\n",
      "at the ceiling.\n",
      "\"Sir?\" said Harry. “I've been thinking…..sir\n",
      "Vol-, I mean, You-Know-Who -\"\n",
      "even if the Stone's gone,\n",
      "\"Call him Voldemort, Harry. Always use the proper name for things. Fear\n",
      "of a name increases fear of the thing itself.\"\n",
      "\"Yes, sir. Well, Voldemort's going to try other ways of coming back, isn't\n",
      "he? I mean, he hasn't gone, has he?”\n",
      "\"No, Harry, he has not. He is still out there somewhere, perhaps looking\n",
      "for another body to share...not being truly alive, he cannot be killed. He left\n",
      "Quirrell to die; he shows just as little mercy to his followers as his enemies.\n",
      "Nevertheless, Harry, while you may only have delayed his return to power, it\n",
      "will merely take someone else who is prepared to fight what seems a losing\n",
      "battle next time and if he is delayed again, and again, why, he may never\n",
      "return to power.”\n",
      "Harry nodded, but stopped quickly, because it made his head hurt. Then\n",
      "he said, \"Sir, there are some other things I'd like to know, if you can tell me...\n",
      "things I want to know the truth about....'\n",
      "99\n",
      "\"The truth.\" Dumbledore sighed. “It is a beautiful and terrible thing, and\n",
      "should therefore be treated with great caution. However, I shall answer your\n",
      "questions unless I have a very good reason not to, in which case I beg you'll\n",
      "forgive me. I shall not, of course, lie.”\n",
      "\"Well... Voldemort said that he only killed my mother because she tried\n",
      "to stop him from killing me. But why would he want to kill me in the first\n",
      "place?\"\n",
      "Dumbledore sighed very deeply this time.\n",
      "“Alas, the first thing you ask me, I cannot tell you. Not today. Not now.\n",
      "You will know, one day…put it from your mind for now, Harry. When you are\n",
      "older...I know you hate to hear this...when you are ready, you will know.\"\n",
      "And Harry knew it would be no good to argue.\n",
      "\"But why couldn't Quirrell touch me?\"\n",
      "\"Your mother died to save you. If there is one thing Voldemort cannot\n",
      "understand, it is love. He didn't realize that love as powerful as your mother's\n",
      "for you leaves its own mark. Not a scar, no visible sign…..to have been loved so\n",
      "deeply, even though the person who loved us is gone, will give us some\n",
      "protection forever. It is in your very skin. Quirrell, full of hatred, greed, and\n",
      "ambition, sharing his soul with Voldemort, could not touch you for this reason. It\n",
      "was agony to touch a person marked by something so good.\"\n",
      "Dumbledore now became very interested in a bird out on the windowsill,\n",
      "which gave Harry time to dry his eyes on the sheet. When he had found his voice\n",
      "again, Harry said, \"And the invisibility cloak - do you know who sent it to\n",
      "me?\"\n",
      "\"Ah - your father happened to leave it in my possession, and I thought\n",
      "you might like it.\" Dumbledore's eyes twinkled. “Useful things...your father\n",
      "used it mainly for sneaking off to the kitchens to steal food when he was here.\"\n",
      "\"And there's something else...\"\n",
      "\"Fire away.\"\n",
      "true?\"\n",
      "\"Quirrell said Snape -\"\n",
      "\"Professor Snape, Harry.\"\n",
      "“Yes, him Quirrell said he hates me because he hated my father. Is that\n",
      "\"Well, they did rather detest each other. Not unlike yourself and Mr.\n",
      "Malfoy. And then, your father did something Snape could never forgive.\"\n",
      "\"What?\"\n",
      "\"He saved his life.”\n",
      "\"What?\"\n",
      "\"Yes...\" said Dumbledore dreamily. \"Funny, the way people's minds\n",
      "work, isn't it? Professor Snape couldn't bear being in your father's debt…..I do\n",
      "believe he worked so hard to protect you this year because he felt that would\n",
      "make him and your father even. Then he could go back to hating your father's\n",
      "memory in peace....\"\n",
      "Harry tried to understand this but it made his head pound, so he stopped.\n",
      "\"And sir, there's one more thing…...”\n",
      "\"Just the one?\"\n",
      "\"How did I get the Stone out of the mirror?\"\n",
      "\"Ah, now, I'm glad you asked me that. It was one of my more brilliant\n",
      "ideas, and between you and me, that's saying something. You see, only one who\n",
      "wanted to find the Stone find it, but not use it would be able to get it,\n",
      "otherwise they'd just see themselves making gold or drinking Elixir of Life. My\n",
      "—\n",
      "brain surprises even me sometimes... Now, enough questions. I suggest you\n",
      "make a start on these sweets. Ah! Bettie Bott's Every Flavor Beans! I was\n",
      "unfortunate enough in my youth to come across a vomit flavored one, and since\n",
      "then I'm afraid I've rather lost my liking for them — but I think I'll be safe with\n",
      "a nice toffee, don't you?\"\n",
      "He smiled and popped the golden-brown bean into his mouth. Then he\n",
      "choked and said, \"Alas! Ear wax!\"\n",
      "Madam Pomfrey, the nurse, was a nice woman,\n",
      "\"Just five minutes,\" Harry pleaded.\n",
      "\"Absolutely not.\"\n",
      "\"You let Professor Dumbledore in…”\n",
      "\"Well, of course, that was the headmaster, quite different. You need rest.”\n",
      "“I am resting, look, lying down and everything. Oh, go on, Madam\n",
      "Pomfrey...\n",
      "but very strict.\n",
      "\"Oh, very well,\" she said. “But five minutes only.\"\n",
      "And she let Ron and Hermione in.\n",
      "\"Harry!\"\n",
      "Hermione looked ready to fling her arms around him again, but Harry\n",
      "was glad she held herself in as his head was still very sore.\n",
      "\"Oh, Harry, we were sure you were going to\n",
      "Dumbledore was so\n",
      "99\n",
      "\"The whole school's talking about it,\" said Ron. \"What really\n",
      "happened?\"\n",
      "It was one of those rare occasions when the true story is even more\n",
      "strange and exciting than the wild rumors. Harry told them everything: Quirrell;\n",
      "the mirror; the Stone; and Voldemort. Ron and Hermione were a very good\n",
      "audience; they gasped in all the right places, and when Harry told them what was\n",
      "under Quirrell's turban, Hermione screamed out loud.\n",
      "worried\n",
      "\"So the Stone's gone?\" said Ron finally. \"Flamel's just going to die?\"\n",
      "\"That's what I said, but Dumbledore thinks that what was it?\n",
      "the well-organized mind, death is but the next great adventure.”\n",
      "\"I always said he was off his rocker,\" said Ron, looking quite impressed\n",
      "at how crazy his hero was.\n",

      "\"So what happened to you two?\" said Harry.\n",
      "\"Well, I got back all right,\" said Hermione. \"I brought Ron round - that\n",
      "took a while and we were dashing up to the owlery to contact Dumbledore\n",
      "when we met him in the entrance hall he already knew he just said,\n",
      "'Harry's gone after him, hasn't he?' and hurtled off to the third floor.\"\n",
      "“D’you think he meant you to do it?\" said Ron. \"Sending you your\n",
      "father's cloak and everything?\"\n",
      "\"Well,\" Hermione exploded, “if he did – I mean to say that's terrible\n",
      "you could have been killed.”\n",
      "\"No, it isn't,\" said Harry thoughtfully. \"He's a funny man, Dumbledore. I\n",
      "think he sort of wanted to give me a chance. I think he knows more or less\n",
      "everything that goes on here, you know. I reckon he had a pretty good idea we\n",
      "were going to try, and instead of stopping us, he just taught us enough to help. I\n",
      "don't think it was an accident he let me find out how the mirror worked. It's\n",
      "almost like he thought I had the right to face Voldemort if I could……..”\n",
      "\"Yeah, Dumbledore's off his rocker, all right,” said Ron proudly. “Listen,\n",
      "you've got to be up for the end-of-year feast tomorrow. The points are all in and\n",
      "Slytherin won, of course you missed the last Quidditch match, we were\n",
      "steamrollered by Ravenclaw without you but the food'll be good.\"\n",
      "At that moment, Madam Pomfrey bustled over.\n",
      "\"You've had nearly fifteen minutes, now OUT\" she said firmly.\n",
      "After a good night's sleep, Harry felt nearly back to normal.\n",
      "I want to go to the feast,\" he told Madam Pomfrey as she straightened his\n",
      "many candy boxes. I can, can't I?\"\n",
      "\"Professor Dumbledore says you are to be allowed to go,\" she said\n",
      "stiffly, as though in her opinion Professor Dumbledore didn't realize how risky\n",
      "feasts could be. “And you have another visitor.\"\n",
      "\"Oh, good,\" said Harry. \"Who is it?\"\n",
      "Hagrid sidled through the door as he spoke. As usual when he was\n",
      "indoors, Hagrid looked too big to be allowed. He sat down next to Harry, took\n",
      "one look at him, and burst into tears.\n",
      "\"It's\n",
      "all my ruddy\n",

      "told the evil git how ter get past Fluffy! I told him! It was the only thing he\n",

      "\"Nah. Dumbledore gave me the day off yesterday ter fix it. 'course, he\n",

      "covered the wall behind the High Table.\n",
      "When Harry walked in there was a sudden hush, and then everybody\n",
      "started talking loudly at once. He slipped into a seat between Ron and Hermione\n",
      "at the Gryffindor table and tried to ignore the fact that people were standing up\n",
      "to look at him.\n",
      "Fortunately, Dumbledore arrived moments later. The babble died away.\n",
      "\"Another year gone!\" Dumbledore said cheerfully. \"And I must trouble\n",

      "points; in third, Hufflepuff, with three hundred and fifty-two; Ravenclaw has\n",

      "A storm of cheering and stamping broke out from the Slytherin table.\n",
      "Harry could see Draco Malfoy banging his goblet on the table. It was a sickening\n",
      "sight.\n",
      "\"Yes, Yes, well done, Slytherin,\" said Dumbledore. \"However, recent\n",
      "events must be taken into account.\"\n",
      "The room went very still. The Slytherins' smiles faded a little.\n",
      "“Ahem,” said Dumbledore. “I have a few last-minute points to dish out.\n",
      "Let me see. Yes...\n",
      "\"First — to Mr. Ronald Weasley...\"\n",

      "\"...for the best-played game of chess Hogwarts has seen in many years, I\n",

      "Gryffindor cheers nearly raised the bewitched ceiling; the stars overhead\n",
      "seemed to quiver. Percy could be heard telling the other prefects, \"My brother,\n",
      "you know! My youngest brother! Got past McGonagall's giant chess set!\"\n",
      "At last there was silence again.\n",
      "\"Second\n",
      "to Miss Hermione Granger...for the use of cool logic in the\n",
      "face of fire, I award Gryffindor house fifty points.\"\n",
      "Hermione buried her face in her arms; Harry strongly suspected she had\n",
      "burst into tears. Gryffindors up and down the table were beside themselves\n",
      "they were a hundred points up.\n",
      "\"Third to Mr. Harry Potter...” said Dumbledore. The room went\n",
      "deadly quiet. \"...for pure nerve and outstanding courage, I award Gryffindor\n",
      "house sixty points.\"\n",
      "The din was deafening. Those who could add up while yelling\n",
      "themselves hoarse knew that Gryffindor now had four hundred and seventy-two\n",
      "points exactly the same as Slytherin. They had tied for the house cup — if\n",
      "only Dumbledore had given Harry just one more point.\n",
      "Dumbledore raised his hand. The room gradually fell silent.\n",
      "\"There are all kinds of courage,\" said Dumbledore, smiling. \"It takes a\n",
      "great deal of bravery to stand up to our enemies, but just as much to stand up to\n",
      "our friends. I therefore award ten points to Mr. Neville Longbottom.\"\n",
      "Someone standing outside the Great Hall might well have thought some\n",
      "sort of explosion had taken place, so loud was the noise that erupted from the\n",
      "Gryffindor table. Harry, Ron, and Hermione stood up to yell and cheer as\n",
      "Neville, white with shock, disappeared under a pile of people hugging him. He\n",
      "had never won so much as a point for Gryffindor before. Harry, still cheering,\n",
      "nudged Ron in the ribs and pointed at Malfoy, who couldn't have looked more\n",

      "and the silver became gold; the huge Slytherin serpent vanished and a towering\n",
      "Gryffindor lion took its place. Snape was shaking Professor McGonagall's hand,\n",
      "with a horrible, forced smile. He caught Harry's eye and Harry knew at once that\n",
      "Snape's feelings toward him hadn't changed one jot. This didn't worry Harry. It\n",
      "seemed as though life would be back to normal next year, or as normal as it ever\n",
      "was at Hogwarts.\n",
      "It was the best evening of Harry's life, better than winning at Quidditch,\n",

      "they did. To their great surprise, both he and Ron passed with good marks;\n",

      "windowsill, staring down at the lights of passing cars and wondering....\n",

      "\"Wouldn't it be better just to go home, dear?\" Aunt Petunia suggested\n",
      "timidly, hours later, but Uncle Vernon didn't seem to hear her. Exactly what he\n",
      "was looking for, none of them knew. He drove them into the middle of a forest,\n",
      "got out, looked around, shook his head, got back in the car, and off they went\n",
      "again. The same thing happened in the middle of a plowed field, halfway across\n",
      "a suspension bridge, and at the top of a multilevel parking garage.\n",
      "\"Daddy's gone mad, hasn't he?\" Dudley asked Aunt Petunia dully late\n",
      "that afternoon. Uncle Vernon had parked at the coast, locked them all inside the\n",
      "car, and disappeared.\n",
      "It started to rain. Great drops beat on the roof of the car. Dudley sniveled.\n",
      "\"It's Monday,\" he told his mother. \"The Great Humberto's on tonight. I\n",
      "want to stay somewhere with a television.\"\n",
      "Monday. This reminded Harry of something. If it was Monday - and\n",
      "you could usually count on Dudley to know the days the week, because of\n",
      "television then tomorrow, Tuesday, was Harry's eleventh birthday. Of course,\n",
      "his birthdays were never exactly fun — last year, the Dursleys had given him a\n",
      "coat hanger and a pair of Uncle Vernon's old socks. Still, you weren't eleven\n",
      "every day.\n",
      "Uncle Vernon was back and he was smiling. He was also carrying a long,\n",
      "thin package and didn't answer Aunt Petunia when she asked what he'd bought.\n",
      "\"Found the perfect place!” he said. “Come on! Everyone out!\"\n",
      "It was very cold outside the car. Uncle Vernon was pointing at what\n",
      "looked like a large rock way out at sea. Perched on top of the rock was the most\n",
      "miserable little shack you could imagine. One thing was certain, there was no\n",
      "television in there.\n",
      "\"Storm forecast for tonight!\" said Uncle Vernon gleefully, clapping his\n",
      "hands together. \"And this gentleman's kindly agreed to lend us his boat!\"\n",
      "A toothless old man came ambling up to them, pointing, with a rather\n",
      "wicked grin, at an old rowboat bobbing in the iron-gray water below them.\n",
      "\"I've already got us some rations,” said Uncle Vernon, “so all aboard!”\n",
      "It was freezing in the boat. Icy sea spray and rain crept down their necks\n",
      "and a chilly wind whipped their faces. After what seemed like hours they\n",
      "reached the rock, where Uncle Vernon, slipping and sliding, led the way to the\n",
      "broken-down house.\n",
      "The inside was horrible; it smelled strongly of seaweed, the wind\n",
      "whistled through the gaps in the wooden walls, and the fireplace was damp and\n",
      "empty. There were only two rooms.\n",
      "Uncle Vernon's rations turned out to be a bag of chips each and four\n",
      "bananas. He tried to start a fire but the empty chip bags just smoked and\n",
      "shriveled up.\n",
      "\"Could do with some of those letters now, eh?” he said cheerfully.\n",
      "He was in a very good mood. Obviously he thought nobody stood a\n",
      "chance of reaching them here in a storm to deliver mail. Harry privately agreed,\n",
      "though the thought didn't cheer him up at all.\n",
      "As night fell, the promised storm blew up around them. Spray from the\n",
      "high waves splattered the walls of the hut and a fierce wind rattled the filthy\n",
      "windows. Aunt Petunia found a few moldy blankets in the second room and\n",
      "made up a bed for Dudley on the moth-eaten sofa. She and Uncle Vernon went\n",
      "off to the lumpy bed next door, and Harry was left to find the softest bit of floor\n",
      "he could and to curl up under the thinnest, most ragged blanket.\n",
      "The storm raged more and more ferociously as the night went on. Harry\n",
      "couldn't sleep. He shivered and turned over, trying to get comfortable, his\n",
      "stomach rumbling with hunger. Dudley's snores were drowned by the low rolls\n",
      "of thunder that started near midnight. The lighted dial of Dudley's watch, which\n",
      "was dangling over the edge of the sofa on his fat wrist, told Harry he'd be eleven\n",
      "in ten minutes' time. He lay and watched his birthday tick nearer, wondering if\n",
      "the Dursleys would remember at all, wondering where the letter writer was now.\n",
      "Five minutes to go. Harry heard something creak outside. He hoped the\n",
      "roof wasn't going to fall in, although he might be warmer if it did. Four minutes\n",
      "to go. Maybe the house in Privet Drive would be so full of letters when they got\n",
      "back that he'd be able to steal one somehow.\n",
      "Three minutes to go. Was that the sea, slapping hard on the rock like\n",
      "that? And (two minutes to go) what was that funny crunching noise? Was the\n",
      "rock crumbling into the sea?\n",
      "One minute to go and he'd be eleven. Thirty seconds...twenty...ten…..\n",
      "maybe he'd wake Dudley up, just to annoy him three...two...one…..\n",
      "BOOM.\n",
      "nine\n",

      "The door was hit with such force that it swung clean off its hinges and\n",
      "with a deafening crash landed flat on the floor.\n",
      "A giant of a man was standing in the doorway. His face was almost\n",
      "completely hidden by a long, shaggy mane of hair and a wild, tangled beard, but\n",
      "you could make out his eyes, glinting like black beetles under all the hair.\n",

      "into its frame. The noise of the storm outside dropped a little. He turned to look\n",
      "at them all.\n",
      "\"Couldn't make us a cup o' tea, could yeh? It's not been an easy journey.\n",
      "He strode over to the sofa where Dudley sat frozen with fear.\n",

      "famous place.\"\n",
      "It was a tiny, grubby-looking pub. If Hagrid hadn't pointed it out, Harry\n",

      "mention this, Hagrid had steered him inside.\n",
      "For a famous place, it was very dark and shabby. A few old women were\n",
      "sitting in a corner, drinking tiny glasses of sherry. One of them was smoking a\n",
      "long pipe. A little man in a top hat was talking to the old bartender, who was\n",
      "quite bald and looked like a toothless walnut. The low buzz of chatter stopped\n",
      "when they walked in. Everyone seemed to know Hagrid; they waved and smiled\n",

      "\"He remembers!\" cried Dedalus Diggle, looking around at everyone.\n",
      "\"Did you hear that? He remembers me!\" Harry shook hands again and again -\n",
      "Doris Crockford kept coming back for more.\n",
      "A pale young man made his way forward, very nervously. One of his\n",
      "eyes was twitching.\n",
      "\"Professor Quirrell!\" said Hagrid. \"Harry, Professor Quirrell will be one\n",
      "of your teachers at Hogwarts.\"\n",
      "\"P-P-Potter,\" stammered Professor Quirrell, grasping Harry's hand, \"c-\n",
      "can't t-tell you how p-pleased I am to meet you.\"\n",
      "\"What sort of magic do you teach, Professor Quirrell?”\n",
      "\"D-Defense Against the D-D-Dark Arts,\" muttered Professor Quirrell, as\n",

      "He laughed nervously. \"You'll be g-getting all your equipment, I suppose? I've\n",

      "the very thought.\n",
      "But the others wouldn't let Professor Quirrell keep Harry to himself. It\n",
      "took almost ten minutes to get away from them all. At last, Hagrid managed to\n",

      "\"Must get on — lots ter buy. Come on, Harry.\"\n",
      "Doris Crockford shook Harry's hand one last time, and Hagrid led them\n",
      "through the bar and out into a small, walled courtyard, where there was nothing\n",
      "but a trash can and a few weeds.\n",
      "Hagrid grinned at Harry.\n",
      "\"Told yeh, didn't I? Told yeh you was famous. Even Professor Quirrell\n",
      "was tremblin' ter meet yeh mind you, he's usually tremblin'.\"\n",
      "\"Is he always that nervous?\"\n",
      "\"Oh, yeah. Poor bloke. Brilliant mind. He was fine while he was studyin'\n",
      "outta books but then he took a year off ter get some firsthand experience.... They\n",
      "say he met vampires in the Black Forest, and there was a nasty bit o' trouble with\n",

      "subject - now, where's me umbrella?”\n",
      "Vampires? Hags? Harry's head was swimming. Hagrid, meanwhile, was\n",
      "counting bricks in the wall above the trash can.\n",
      "\"Three up...two across...” he muttered. “Right, stand back, Harry.\"\n",
      "He tapped the wall three times with the point of his umbrella.\n",
      "The brick he had touched quivered - it wriggled in the middle, a\n",
      "small hole appeared\n",
      "it grew wider and wider a second later they were\n",
      "facing an archway large enough even for Hagrid, an archway onto a cobbled\n",
      "street that twisted and turned out of sight.\n",
      "\"Welcome,\" said Hagrid, \"to Diagon Alley.\"\n",
      "He grinned at Harry's amazement. They stepped through the archway.\n",
      "Harry looked quickly over his shoulder and saw the archway shrink instantly\n",
      "back into solid wall.\n",
      "The sun shone brightly on a stack of cauldrons outside the nearest shop.\n",
      "Cauldrons All Sizes Copper, Brass, Pewter, Silver Self-Stirring -\n",
      "Collapsible, said a sign hanging over them.\n",
      "\"Yeah, you'll be needin' one,” said Hagrid, “but we gotta get yer money\n",
      "first.\"\n",
      "Harry wished he had about eight more eyes. He turned his head in every\n",
      "direction as they walked up the street, trying to look at everything at once: the\n",
      "shops, the things outside them, the people doing their shopping. A plump woman\n",
      "outside an Apothecary was shaking her head as they passed, saying, \"Dragon\n",
      "liver, seventeen Sickles an ounce, they're mad……..”\n",
      "A low, soft hooting came from a dark shop with a sign saying Eeylops\n",
      "Owl Emporium - Tawny, Screech, Barn, Brown, and Snowy. Several boys of\n",
      "about Harry's age had their noses pressed against a window with broomsticks in\n",
      "it. \"Look,\" Harry heard one of them say, \"the new Nimbus Two Thousand\n",
      "fastest ever\" There were shops selling robes, shops selling telescopes and\n",
      "strange silver instruments Harry had never seen before, windows stacked with\n",
      "barrels of bat spleens and eels' eyes, tottering piles of spell books, quills, and\n",
      "rolls of parchment, potion bottles, globes of the moon....\n",
      "\"Gringotts,\" said Hagrid.\n",
      "They had reached a snowy white building that towered over the other\n",
      "little shops. Standing beside its burnished bronze doors, wearing a uniform of\n",
      "scarlet and gold, was\n",
      "\"Yeah, that's a goblin,” said Hagrid quietly as they walked up the white\n",
      "stone steps toward him. The goblin was about a head shorter than Harry. He had\n",
      "a swarthy, clever face, a pointed beard and, Harry noticed, very long fingers and\n",
      "feet. He bowed as they walked inside. Now they were facing a second pair of\n",
      "doors, silver this time, with words engraved upon them:\n",
      "Enter, stranger, but take heed\n",
      "Of what awaits the sin of greed,\n",
      "For those who take, but do not earn,\n",
      "Must pay most dearly in their turn.\n",
      "So if you seek beneath our floors\n",
      "A treasure that was never yours,\n",
      "Thief, you have been warned, beware\n",
      "Of finding more than treasure there.\n",
      "\"Like I said, Yeh'd be mad ter try an' rob it,\" said Hagrid.\n",
      "A pair of goblins bowed them through the silver doors and they were in a\n",
      "vast marble hall. About a hundred more goblins were sitting on high stools\n",
      "behind a long counter, scribbling in large ledgers, weighing coins in brass scales,\n",
      "examining precious stones through eyeglasses. There were too many doors to\n",
      "count leading off the hall, and yet more goblins were showing people in and out\n",
      "of these. Hagrid and Harry made for the counter.\n",
      "\"Morning,\" said Hagrid to a free goblin. \"We've come ter take some\n",
      "money outta Mr. Harry Potter's safe.\"\n",
      "\"You have his key, sir?\"\n",
      "\"Got it here somewhere,\" said Hagrid, and he started emptying his\n",
      "pockets onto the counter, scattering a handful of moldy dog biscuits over the\n",
      "goblin's book of numbers. The goblin wrinkled his nose. Harry watched the\n",
      "goblin on their right weighing a pile of rubies as big as glowing coals.\n",
      "\"Got it,\" said Hagrid at last, holding up a tiny golden key.\n",
      "The goblin looked at it closely.\n",
      "\"That seems to be in order.\"\n",
      "\"An' I've also got a letter here from Professor Dumbledore,” said Hagrid\n",
      "importantly, throwing out his chest. \"It's about the You-Know-What in vault\n",
      "seven hundred and thirteen.\"\n",
      "The goblin read the letter carefully.\n",
      "\"Very well,\" he said, handing it back to Hagrid, \"I will have someone\n",
      "take you down to both vaults. Griphook!\"\n",
      "Griphook was yet another goblin. Once Hagrid had crammed all the dog\n",
      "biscuits back inside his pockets, he and Harry followed Griphook toward one of\n",
      "the doors leading off the hall.\n",
      "\"What's the You-Know-What in vault seven hundred and thirteen?\"\n",
      "Harry asked.\n",
      "\"Can't tell yeh that,\" said Hagrid mysteriously. \"Very secret. Hogwarts\n",
      "business. Dumbledore's trusted me. More'n my job's worth ter tell yeh that.\"\n",
      "Griphook held the door open for them. Harry, who had expected more\n",
      "marble, was surprised. They were in a narrow stone passageway lit with flaming\n",
      "torches. It sloped steeply downward and there were little railway tracks on the\n",
      "floor. Griphook whistled and a small cart came hurtling up the tracks toward\n",
      "them. They climbed in - Hagrid with some difficulty and were off.\n",
      "At first they just hurtled through a maze of twisting passages. Harry tried\n",
      "to remember, left, right, right, left, middle fork, right, left, but it was impossible.\n",
      "The rattling cart seemed to know its own way, because Griphook wasn't\n",
      "steering.\n",
      "Harry's eyes stung as the cold air rushed past them, but he kept them\n",
      "wide open. Once, he thought he saw a burst of fire at the end of a passage and\n",
      "twisted around to see if it was a dragon, but too late they plunged even\n",
      "deeper, passing an underground lake where huge stalactites and stalagmites grew\n",
      "from the ceiling and floor.\n",
      "\"I never know,\" Harry called to Hagrid over the noise of the cart, \"what's\n",
      "the difference between a stalagmite and a stalactite?\"\n",
      "\"Stalagmite's got an 'm' in it,\" said Hagrid. \"An' don' ask me questions\n",
      "just now, I think I'm gonna be sick.\"\n",
      "He did look very green, and when the cart stopped at last beside a small\n",
      "door in the passage wall, Hagrid got out and had to lean against the wall to stop\n",
      "his knees from trembling.\n",
      "Griphook unlocked the door. A lot of green smoke came billowing out,\n",
      "and as it cleared, Harry gasped. Inside were mounds of gold coins. Columns of\n",
      "silver. Heaps of little bronze Knuts.\n",
      "\"All yours,\" smiled Hagrid.\n",
      "All Harry's\n",
      "—\n",
      "it was incredible. The Dursleys couldn't have known\n",
      "about this or they'd have had it from him faster than blinking. How often had\n",
      "they complained how much Harry cost them to keep? And all the time there had\n",
      "been a small fortune belonging to him, buried deep under London.\n",
      "Hagrid helped Harry pile some of it into a bag.\n",
      "\"The gold ones are Galleons,\" he explained. \"Seventeen silver Sickles to\n",
      "a Galleon and twenty-nine Knuts to a Sickle, it's easy enough. Right, that should\n",
      "be enough fer a couple o' terms, we'll keep the rest safe for yeh.\" He turned to\n",
      "Griphook. \"Vault seven hundred and thirteen now, please, and can we go more\n",
      "slowly?\"\n",
      "\"One speed only,\" said Griphook.\n",
      "They were going even deeper now and gathering speed. The air became\n",
      "colder and colder as they hurtled round tight corners. They went rattling over an\n",
      "underground ravine, and Harry leaned over the side to try to see what was down\n",
      "at the dark bottom, but Hagrid groaned and pulled him back by the scruff of his\n",
      "neck.\n",
      "Vault seven hundred and thirteen had no keyhole.\n",
      "\"Stand back,\" said Griphook importantly. He stroked the door gently\n",
      "with one of his long fingers and it simply melted away.\n",
      "\"If anyone but a Gringotts goblin tried that, they'd be sucked through the\n",
      "door and trapped in there,\" said Griphook.\n",
      "\"How often do you check to see if anyone's inside?\" Harry asked.\n",
      "\"About once every ten years,\" said Griphook with a rather nasty grin.\n",
      "Something really extraordinary had to be inside this top security vault,\n",
      "Harry was sure, and he leaned forward eagerly, expecting to see fabulous jewels\n",
      "at the very least — but at first he thought it was empty. Then he noticed a grubby\n",
      "little package wrapped up in brown paper lying on the floor. Hagrid picked it up\n",
      "and tucked it deep inside his coat. Harry longed to know what it was, but knew\n",
      "better than to ask.\n",
      "\"Come on, back in this infernal cart, and don't talk to me on the way\n",
      "back, it's best if I keep me mouth shut,\" said Hagrid.\n",
      "One wild cart ride later they stood blinking in the sunlight outside Gringotts.\n",
      "Harry didn't know where to run first now that he had a bag full of money. He\n",
      "didn't have to know how many Galleons there were to a pound to know that he\n",
      "was holding more money than he'd had in his whole life more money than\n",
      "even Dudley had ever had.\n",
      "\"Might as well get yer uniform,” said Hagrid, nodding toward Madam\n",
      "Malkin's Robes for All Occasions. \"Listen, Harry, would yeh mind if I slipped\n",
      "off fer a pick-me-up in the Leaky Cauldron? I hate them Gringotts carts.\" He did\n",
      "still look a bit sick, so Harry entered Madam Malkin's shop alone, feeling\n",
      "nervous.\n",
      "Madam Malkin was a squat, smiling witch dressed all in mauve.\n",
      "\"Hogwarts, dear?\" she said, when Harry started to speak. \"Got the lot\n",
      "here — another young man being fitted up just now, in fact.”\n",
      "In the back of the shop, a boy with a pale, pointed face was standing on a\n",
      "footstool while a second witch pinned up his long black robes. Madam Malkin\n",
      "stood Harry on a stool next to him slipped a long robe over his head, and began\n",
      "to pin it to the right length.\n",
      "\"Hello,\" said the boy, \"Hogwarts, too?\"\n",
      "“Yes,” said Harry.\n",
      "\"My father's next door buying my books and mother's up the street\n",
      "looking at wands,\" said the boy. He had a bored, drawling voice. “Then I'm\n",
      "going to drag them off to took at racing brooms. I don't see why first years can't\n",
      "have their own. I think I'll bully father into getting me one and I'll smuggle it in\n",
      "somehow.\"\n",
      "Harry was strongly reminded of Dudley.\n",
      "\"Have you got your own broom?\" the boy went on.\n",
      "\"No,\" said Harry.\n",
      "\"Play Quidditch at all?\"\n",
      "\"No,\" Harry said again, wondering what on earth Quidditch could be.\n",
      "\"I do\n",
      "Father says it's a crime if I'm not picked to play for my house,\n",
      "and I must say, I agree. Know what house you'll be in yet?\"\n",
      "\"No,\" said Harry, feeling more stupid by the minute.\n",
      "\"Well, no one really knows until they get there, do they, but I know I'll\n",
      "be in Slytherin, all our family have been — imagine being in Hufflepuff, I think\n",
      "I'd leave, wouldn't you?\"\n",
      "\"Mmm,\" said Harry, wishing he could say something a bit more\n",
      "interesting.\n",
      "\"I say, look at that man!\" said the boy suddenly, nodding toward the front\n",
      "window. Hagrid was standing there, grinning at Harry and pointing at two large\n",
      "ice creams to show he couldn't come in.\n",
      "\"That's Hagrid,\" said Harry, pleased to know something the boy didn't.\n",
      "\"He works at Hogwarts.\"\n",
      "\"Oh,\" said the boy, \"I've heard of him. He's a sort of servant, isn't he?”\n",
      "\"He's the gamekeeper,\" said Harry. He was liking the boy less and less\n",
      "every second.\n",
      "\"Yes, exactly. I heard he's a sort of savage - lives in a hut on the school\n",
      "grounds and every now and then he gets drunk, tries to do magic, and ends up\n",
      "setting fire to his bed.”\n",
      "\"I think he's brilliant,\" said Harry coldly.\n",
      "\"Do you?\" said the boy, with a slight sneer. \"Why is he with you? Where\n",
      "are your parents?”\n",
      "\"They're dead,\" said Harry shortly. He didn't feel much like going into\n",
      "the matter with this boy.\n",
      "\"Oh, sorry,\" said the other, not sounding sorry at all. \"But they were our\n",
      "kind, weren't they?\"\n",
      "\"They were a witch and wizard, if that's what you mean.”\n",
      "\"I really don't think they should let the other sort in, do you? They're just\n",
      "not the same, they've never been brought up to know our ways. Some of them\n",
      "have never even heard of Hogwarts until they get the letter, imagine. I think they\n",
      "should keep it in the old wizarding families. What's your surname, anyway?”\n",
      "But before Harry could answer, Madam Malkin said, “That's you done,\n",
      "my dear,\" and Harry, not sorry for an excuse to stop talking to the boy, hopped\n",
      "down from the footstool.\n",
      "\"Well, I'll see you at Hogwarts, I suppose,\" said the drawling boy.\n",
      "Harry was rather quiet as he ate the ice cream Hagrid had bought him\n",
      "(chocolate and raspberry with chopped nuts).\n",
      "\"What's up?\" said Hagrid.\n",
      "\"Nothing,\" Harry lied. They stopped to buy parchment and quills. Harry\n",
      "cheered up a bit when he found a bottle of ink that changed color as you wrote.\n",
      "When they had left the shop, he said, \"Hagrid, what's Quidditch?\"\n",
      "\"Blimey, Harry, I keep forgettin' how little yeh know not knowin'\n",
      "about Quidditch!\"\n",
      "\"Don't make me feel worse,” said Harry. He told Hagrid about the pale\n",
      "boy in Madam Malkin's.\n",
      "and he said people from Muggle families shouldn't even be allowed\n",
      "in\n",

      "\"And what are Slytherin and Hufflepuff?\"\n",
      "\"School houses. There's four. Everyone says Hufflepuff are a lot o'\n",
      "duffers, but —”\n",
      "\"I bet I'm in Hufflepuff,\" said Harry gloomily.\n",
      "\"Better Hufflepuff than Slytherin,\" said Hagrid darkly. \"There's not a\n",
      "single witch or wizard who went bad who wasn't in Slytherin. You-Know-Who\n",
      "was one.\"\n",
      "\"Vol-, sorry\n",
      "-You-Know-Who was at Hogwarts?\"\n",
      "\"Years an' years ago,” said Hagrid.\n",

      "where the shelves were stacked to the ceiling with books as large as paving\n",
      "stones bound in leather; books the size of postage stamps in covers of silk; books\n",
      "full of peculiar symbols and a few books with nothing in them at all. Even\n",

      "Hagrid must have forgotten to tell him something you had to do, like\n",
      "tapping the third brick on the left to get into Diagon Alley. He wondered if he\n",

      "\"Sorry, George, dear.\"\n",

      "gone but how had he done it?\n",
      "Now the third brother was walking briskly toward the barrier he was\n",
      "almost there and then, quite suddenly, he wasn't anywhere.\n",
      "There was nothing else for it.\n",
      "\"Excuse me,\" Harry said to the plump woman.\n",
      "\"Hello, dear,\" she said. \"First time at Hogwarts? Ron's new, too.\"\n",
      "She pointed at the last and youngest of her sons. He was tall, thin, and\n",

      "\"Yes,\" said Harry. \"The thing is - the thing is, I don't know how to\n",
      "\"How to get onto the platform?\" she said kindly, and Harry nodded.\n",
      "\"Not to worry,\" she said. “All you have to do is walk straight at the\n",
      "barrier between platforms nine and ten. Don't stop and don't be scared you'll\n",
      "crash into it, that's very important. Best do it at a bit of a run if you're nervous.\n",

      "ready for the crash\n",
      "99\n",

      "heavy run the barrier was coming nearer and nearer he wouldn't be able to\n",
      "the cart was out of control he was a foot away\n",
      "he closed his eyes\n",
      "It didn't come...he kept on running...he opened his eyes. A scarlet steam\n",
      "engine was waiting next to a platform packed with people. A sign overhead said\n",
      "Hogwarts' Express, eleven o'clock. Harry looked behind him and saw a\n",
      "wrought-iron archway where the barrier had been, with the words Platform Nine\n",
      "and Three-Quarters on it, He had done it.\n",
      "Smoke from the engine drifted over the heads of the chattering crowd,\n",
      "while cats of every color wound here and there between their legs. Owls hooted\n",
      "to one another in a disgruntled sort of way over the babble and the scraping of\n",
      "heavy trunks.\n",
      "The first few carriages were already packed with students, some hanging\n",
      "out of the window to talk to their families, some fighting over seats. Harry\n",
      "pushed his cart off down the platform in search of an empty seat. He passed a\n",
      "round-faced boy who was saying, \"Gran, I've lost my toad again.\"\n",
      "\"Oh, Neville,\" he heard the old woman sigh.\n",
      "A boy with dreadlocks was surrounded by a small crowd.\n",
      "\"Give us a look, Lee, go on.\"\n",
      "The boy lifted the lid of a box in his arms, and the people around him\n",
      "shrieked and yelled as something inside poked out a long, hairy leg.\n",
      "Harry pressed on through the crowd until he found an empty\n",
      "compartment near the end of the train. He put Hedwig inside first and then\n",
      "started to shove and heave his trunk toward the train door. He tried to lift it up\n",

      "foot.\n",
      "\"Want a hand?\" It was one of the red-haired twins he'd followed through\n",
      "the barrier.\n",
      "\"Yes, please,\" Harry panted.\n",
      "\"Oy, Fred! C'mere and help!\"\n",
      "With the twins' help, Harry's trunk was at last tucked away in a corner of\n",
      "the compartment.\n",
      "\"Thanks,\" said Harry, pushing his sweaty hair out of his eyes.\n",
      "\"What's that?\" said one of the twins suddenly, pointing at Harry's\n",
      "lightning scar.\n",
      "\"Blimey,\" said the other twin. \"Are you —?”\n",

      "and they learn quick enough.\"\n",
      "While they had been talking, the train had carried them out of London.\n",
      "Now they were speeding past fields full of cows and sheep. They were quiet for\n",

      "Around half past twelve there was a great clattering outside in the\n",

      "off the cart, dears?\"\n",
      "Harry, who hadn't had any breakfast, leapt to his feet, but Ron's ears\n",
      "went pink again and he muttered that he'd brought sandwiches. Harry went out\n",
      "into the corridor.\n",
      "He had never had any money for candy with the Dursleys, and now that\n",
      "he had pockets rattling with gold and silver he was ready to buy as many Mars\n",

      "Sickles and seven bronze Knuts.\n",
      "Ron stared as Harry brought it all back in to the compartment and tipped\n",
      "it onto an empty seat.\n",
      "\"Hungry, are you?\"\n",
      "\"Starving,\" said Harry, taking a large bite out of a pumpkin pasty.\n",
      "Ron had taken out a lumpy package and unwrapped it. There were four\n",
      "sandwiches inside. He pulled one of them apart and said, \"She always forgets I\n",
      "don't like corned beef..\"\n",
      "\"Swap you for one of these,\" said Harry, holding up a pasty. \"Go on\n",
      "\"You don't want this, it's all dry,” said Ron. “She hasn't got much time,”\n",
      "he added quickly, “you know, with five of us.\"\n",
      "\"9\n",
      "\"Go on, have a pasty,” said Harry, who had never had anything to share\n",
      "before or, indeed, anyone to share it with. It was a nice feeling, sitting there with\n",
      "Ron, eating their way through all Harry's pasties, cakes, and candies (the\n",
      "sandwiches lay forgotten).\n",
      "\"What are these?\" Harry asked Ron, holding up a pack of Chocolate\n",
      "Frogs. \"They're not really frogs, are they?” He was starting to feel that nothing\n",
      "would surprise him.\n",
      "\"No,\" said Ron. \"But see what the card is. I'm missing Agrippa.\"\n",
      "\"What?\"\n",
      "\"Oh, of course, you wouldn't know Chocolate Frogs have cards,\n",
      "inside them, you know, to collect — famous witches and wizards. I've got about\n",
      "five hundred, but I haven't got Agrippa or Ptolemy.\"\n",
      "Harry unwrapped his Chocolate Frog and picked up the card. It showed a\n",
      "man’s face. He wore half-moon glasses, had a long, crooked nose, and flowing\n",
      "silver hair, beard, and mustache. Underneath the picture was the name Albus\n",
      "Dumbledore.\n",
      "\"So this is Dumbledore!\" said Harry.\n",
      "\"Don't tell me you'd never heard of Dumbledore!\" said Ron. \"Can I have\n",
      "a frog? I might get Agrippa - thanks —\"\n",
      "Harry turned over his card and read:\n",
      "ALBUS DUMBLEDORE\n",
      "CURRENTLY HEADMASTER OF HOGWARTS\n",
      "Considered by many the greatest wizard of modern times, Dumbledore is\n",
      "particularly famous for his defeat of the dark wizard Grindelwald in 1945, for\n",
      "the discovery of the twelve uses of dragon's blood, and his work on alchemy\n",
      "with his partner, Nicolas Flamel. Professor Dumbledore enjoys chamber music\n",
      "and tenpin bowling.\n",
      "Harry turned the card back over and saw, to his astonishment, that\n",
      "Dumbledore's face had disappeared.\n",
      "\"He's gone!\"\n",
      "\"Well, you can't expect him to hang around all day,\" said Ron. \"He'll be\n",
      "back. No, I've got Morgana again and I've got about six of her...do you want it?\n",
      "You can start collecting.\"\n",
      "Ron's eyes strayed to the pile of Chocolate Frogs waiting to be\n",
      "unwrapped.\n",
      "\"Help yourself,\" said Harry. “But in, you know, the Muggle world,\n",
      "people just stay put in photos.\"\n",
      "\"Weird!\"\n",
      "\"Do they? What, they don't move at all?\" Ron sounded amazed.\n",
      "Harry stared as Dumbledore sidled back into the picture on his card and\n",
      "gave him a small smile. Ron was more interested in eating the frogs than looking\n",
      "at the Famous Witches and Wizards cards, but Harry couldn't keep his eyes off\n",
      "them. Soon he had not only Dumbledore and Morgana, but Hengist of\n",
      "Woodcroft, Alberic Grunnion, Circe, Paracelsus, and Merlin. He finally tore his\n",
      "eyes away from the Druidess Cliodna, who was scratching her nose, to open a\n",
      "bag of Bertie Bott's Every Flavor Beans.\n",
      "\"You want to be careful with those,\" Ron warned Harry. \"When they say\n",
      "every flavor, they mean every flavor- you know, you get all the ordinary ones\n",
      "like chocolate and peppermint and marmalade, but then you can get spinach and\n",
      "liver and tripe. George reckons he had a booger-flavored one once.\"\n",
      "Ron picked up a green bean, looked at it carefully, and bit into a corner.\n",
      "\"Bleaaargh - see? Sprouts.\"\n",
      "They had a good time eating the Every Flavor Beans. Harry got toast,\n",
      "coconut, baked bean, strawberry, curry, grass, coffee, sardine, and was even\n",
      "brave enough to nibble the end off a funny gray one Ron wouldn't touch, which\n",
      "turned out to be pepper.\n",
      "The countryside now flying past the window was becoming wilder. The\n",
      "neat fields had gone. Now there were woods, twisting rivers, and dark green\n",
      "hills.\n",
      "There was a knock on the door of their compartment and the round-faced\n",
      "boy Harry had passed on platform nine and three-quarters came in. He looked\n",
      "tearful.\n",
      "“Sorry,” he said, “but have you seen a toad at all?”\n",
      "When they shook their heads, he wailed, “I’ve lost him! He keeps getting\n",
      "away from me!”\n",
      "\"He'll turn up,\" said Harry.\n",
      "\"Yes,\" said the boy miserably. \"Well, if you see him…”\n",
      "He left.\n",
      "\"Don't know why he's so bothered,\" said Ron. \"If I'd brought a toad I'd\n",
      "lose it as quick as I could. Mind you, I brought Scabbers, so I can't talk.\"\n",
      "The rat was still snoozing on Ron's lap.\n",
      "\"He might have died and you wouldn't know the difference,\" said Ron in\n",
      "disgust. \"I tried to turn him yellow yesterday to make him more interesting, but\n",
      "the spell didn't work. I'll show you, look...\"\n",
      "He rummaged around in his trunk and pulled out a very battered-looking\n",
      "wand. It was chipped in places and something white was glinting at the end.\n",
      "\"Unicorn hair's nearly poking out. Anyway -\"\n",
      "He had just raised his wand when the compartment door slid open again.\n",
      "The toadless boy was back, but this time he had a girl with him. She was already\n",
      "wearing her new Hogwarts robes.\n",
      "\"Has anyone seen a toad? Neville's lost one,” she said. She had a bossy\n",
      "sort of voice, lots of bushy brown hair, and rather large front teeth.\n",
      "\"We've already told him we haven't seen it,” said Ron, but the girl\n",
      "wasn't listening, she was looking at the wand in his hand.\n",
      "\"Oh, are you doing magic? Let's see it, then.\"\n",
      "She sat down. Ron looked taken aback.\n",
      "\"Er all right.”\n",
      "He cleared his throat.\n",
      "\"Sunshine, daisies, butter mellow,\n",
      "Turn this stupid, fat rat yellow.\"\n",
      "He waved his wand, but nothing happened. Scabbers stayed gray and fast\n",
      "asleep.\n",
      "\"Are you sure that's a real spell?\" said the girl. \"Well, it's not very good,\n",
      "is it? I've tried a few simple spells just for practice and it's all worked for me.\n",
      "Nobody in my family's magic at all, it was ever such a surprise when I got my\n",
      "letter, but I was ever so pleased, of course, I mean, it's the very best school of\n",
      "witchcraft there is, I've heard · I've learned all our course books by heart, of\n",
      "course, I just hope it will be enough - I'm Hermione Granger, by the way, who\n",
      "are you?\"\n",
      "She said all this very fast.\n",
      "Harry looked at Ron, and was relieved to see by his stunned face that he\n",
      "hadn't learned all the course books by heart either.\n",
      "\"I'm Ron Weasley,\" Ron muttered.\n",
      "\"Harry Potter,\" said Harry.\n",
      "\"Are you really?” said Hermione. “I know all about you, of course I\n",
      "got a few extra books, for background reading, and you're in Modern Magical\n",
      "History and The Rise and Fall of the Dark Arts and Great Wizarding Events of\n",
      "the Twentieth Century.\"\n",
      "\"Am I?\" said Harry, feeling dazed.\n",
      "\"Goodness, didn't you know, I'd have found out everything I could if it\n",
      "was me,” said Hermione. “Do either of you know what house you'll be in? I've\n",
      "been asking around, and I hope I'm in Gryffindor, it sounds by far the best; I\n",
      "hear Dumbledore himself was in it, but I suppose Ravenclaw wouldn't be too\n",
      "bad....Anyway, we'd better go and look for Neville's toad. You two had better\n",
      "change, you know, I expect we'll be there soon.\"\n",
      "And she left, taking the toadless boy with her.\n",
      "\"Whatever house I'm in, I hope she's not in it,” said Ron. He threw his\n",
      "wand back into his trunk. \"Stupid spell- George gave it to me, bet he knew it\n",
      "was a dud.\"\n",
      "\"What house are your brothers in?” asked Harry.\n",
      "\"Gryffindor,\" said Ron. Gloom seemed to be settling on him again.\n",
      "\"Mom and Dad were in it, too. I don't know what they'll say if I'm not. I don't\n",
      "suppose Ravenclaw would be too bad, but imagine if they put me in Slytherin.\"\n",
      "\"That's the house Vol-, I mean, You-Know-Who was in?\"\n",
      "\"Yeah,\" said Ron. He flopped back into his seat, looking depressed.\n",
      "\"You know, I think the ends of Scabbers' whiskers are a bit lighter,” said\n",
      "Harry, trying to take Ron's mind off houses. “So what do your oldest brothers do\n",
      "now that they've left, anyway?\"\n",
      "Harry was wondering what a wizard did once he'd finished school.\n",
      "\"Charlie's in Romania studying dragons, and Bill's in Africa doing\n",
      "something for Gringotts,” said Ron. \"Did you hear about Gringotts? It's been all\n",
      "over the Daily Prophet, but I don't suppose you get that with the Muggles\n",
      "someone tried to rob a high security vault.\"\n",
      "Harry stared.\n",
      "\"Really? What happened to them?\"\n",
      "\"Nothing, that's why it's such big news. They haven't been caught. My\n",
      "dad says it must've been a powerful Dark wizard to get round Gringotts, but they\n",
      "don't think they took anything, that's what's odd. 'Course, everyone gets scared\n",
      "when something like this happens in case You-Know-Who's behind it.\"\n",
      "Harry turned this news over in his mind. He was starting to get a prickle\n",
      "of fear every time You-Know-Who was mentioned. He supposed this was all\n",
      "part of entering the magical world, but it had been a lot more comfortable saying\n",
      "\"Voldemort\" without worrying.\n",
      "\"What's your Quidditch team?\" Ron asked.\n",
      "\"Er I don't know any.\" Harry confessed.\n",
      "\"What!\" Ron looked dumbfounded. “Oh, you wait, it's the best game in\n",
      "the world \" And he was off, explaining all about the four balls and the\n",
      "positions of the seven players, describing famous games he'd been to with his\n",
      "brothers and the broomstick he'd like to get if he had the money. He was just\n",
      "taking Harry through the finer points of the game when the compartment door\n",
      "slid open yet again, but it wasn't Neville the toadless boy, or Hermione Granger\n",
      "this time.\n",
      "Three boys entered, and Harry recognized the middle one at once: it was\n",
      "the pale boy from Madam Malkin's robe shop. He was looking at Harry with a\n",
      "lot more interest than he'd shown back in Diagon Alley.\n",
      "\"Is it true?\" he said. \"They're saying all down the train that Harry\n",
      "Potter's in this compartment. So it's you, is it?\"\n",
      "\"Yes,\" said Harry. He was looking at the other boys. Both of them were\n",
      "thickset and looked extremely mean. Standing on either side of the pale boy, they\n",
      "looked like bodyguards.\n",
      "\"Oh, this is Crabbe and this is Goyle,\" said the pale boy carelessly,\n",
      "noticing where Harry was looking. “And my name's Malfoy, Draco Malfoy.\"\n",
      "Ron gave a slight cough, which might have been hiding a snigger. Draco\n",
      "Malfoy looked at him.\n",
      "“Think my name's funny, do you? No need to ask who you are. My\n",
      "father told me all the Weasleys have red hair, freckles, and more children than\n",
      "they can afford.\"\n",
      "He turned back to Harry. \"You'll soon find out some wizarding families\n",
      "are much better than others, Potter. You don't want to go making friends with the\n",
      "wrong sort. I can help you there.”\n",
      "He held out his hand to shake Harry's, but Harry didn't take it.\n",
      "\"I think I can tell who the wrong sort are for myself, thanks,” he said\n",
      "coolly.\n",
      "Draco Malfoy didn't go red, but a pink tinge appeared in his pale cheeks.\n",
      "\"I'd be careful if I were you, Potter,\" he said slowly. \"Unless you're a bit\n",
      "politer you'll go the same way as your parents. They didn't know what was good\n",
      "for them, either. You hang around with riffraff like the Weasleys and that Hagrid,\n",
      "and it'll rub off on you.\"\n",
      "Both Harry and Ron stood up.\n",
      "\"Say that again,\" Ron said, his face as red as his hair.\n",
      "\"Oh, you're going to fight us, are you?\" Malfoy sneered.\n",
      "\"Unless you get out now,\" said Harry, more bravely than he felt, because\n",
      "Crabbe and Goyle were a lot bigger than him or Ron.\n",
      "\"But we don't feet like leaving, do we, boys? We've eaten all our food\n",
      "and you still seem to have some.”\n",
      "Goyle reached toward the Chocolate Frogs next to Ron Ron leapt\n",
      "forward, but before he'd so much as touched Goyle, Goyle let out a horrible yell.\n",
      "Scabbers the rat was hanging off his finger, sharp little teeth sunk deep\n",
      "into Goyle's knuckle — Crabbe and Malfoy backed away as Goyle swung\n",
      "Scabbers round and round, howling, and when Scabbers finally flew off and hit\n",
      "the window, all three of them disappeared at once. Perhaps they thought there\n",
      "were more rats lurking among the sweets, or perhaps they'd heard footsteps,\n",
      "because a second later, Hermione Granger had come in.\n",
      "\"What has been going on?” she said, looking at the sweets all over the\n",
      "floor and Ron picking up Scabbers by his tail.\n",
      "“I think he's been knocked out,\" Ron said to Harry. He looked closer at\n",
      "Scabbers. \"No I don't believe it he's gone back to sleep.\"\n",
      "And so he had.\n",
      "\"You've met Malfoy before?\"\n",
      "Harry explained about their meeting in Diagon Alley.\n",
      "\"I've heard of his family,” said Ron darkly. \"They were some of the first\n",
      "to come back to our side after You-Know-Who disappeared. Said they'd been\n",
      "bewitched. My dad doesn't believe it. He says Malfoy's father didn't need an\n",
      "excuse to go over to the Dark Side.” He turned to Hermione. “Can we help you\n",
      "with something?”\n",
      "\"You'd better hurry up and put your robes on, I've just been up to the\n",
      "front to ask the conductor, and he says we're nearly there. You haven't been\n",
      "fighting, have you? You'll be in trouble before we even get there!”\n",
      "\"Scabbers has been fighting, not us,\" said Ron, scowling at her. \"Would\n",
      "you mind leaving while we change?\"\n",
      "“All right\n",
      "- I only came in here because people outside are behaving\n",
      "very childishly, racing up and down the corridors,\" said Hermione in a sniffy\n",
      "voice. \"And you've got dirt on your nose, by the way, did you know?\"\n",
      "Ron glared at her as she left. Harry peered out of the window. It was\n",
      "getting dark. He could see mountains and forests under a deep purple sky. The\n",
      "train did seem to be slowing down.\n",
      "He and Ron took off their jackets and pulled on their long black robes.\n",
      "Ron's were a bit short for him, you could see his sneakers underneath them.\n",
      "A voice echoed through the train: \"We will be reaching Hogwarts in five\n",

      "Harry's stomach lurched with nerves and Ron, he saw, looked pale under\n",
      "his freckles. They crammed their pockets with the last of the sweets and joined\n",
      "the crowd thronging the corridor.\n",
      "The train slowed right down and finally stopped. People pushed their\n",
      "way toward the door and out on to a tiny, dark platform. Harry shivered in the\n",
      "cold night air. Then a lamp came bobbing over the heads of the students, and\n",

      "He could see the High Table properly now. At the end nearest him sat\n",
      "Hagrid, who caught his eye and gave him the thumbs up. Harry grinned back.\n",
      "And there, in the center of the High Table, in a large gold chair, sat Albus\n",
      "Dumbledore. Harry recognized him at once from the card he'd gotten out of the\n",
      "Chocolate Frog on the train. Dumbledore's silver hair was the only thing in the\n",
      "whole hall that shone as brightly as the ghosts. Harry spotted Professor Quirrell,\n",
      "too, the nervous young man from the Leaky Cauldron. He was looking very\n",
      "peculiar in a large purple turban.\n",
      "And now there were only three people left to be sorted. “Thomas, Dean,\"\n",
      "a Black boy even taller than Ron, joined Harry at the Gryffindor table. \"Turpin,\n",

      "now. Harry crossed his fingers under the table and a second later the hat had\n",
      "shouted, \"GRYFFINDOR!\"\n",
      "Harry clapped loudly with the rest as Ron collapsed into the chair next to\n",
      "him.\n",
      "\"Well done, Ron, excellent,\" said Percy Weasley pompously across Harry\n",
      "as \"Zabini, Blaise,\" was made a Slytherin. Professor McGonagall rolled up her\n",

      "Harry looked down at his empty gold plate. He had only just realized\n",
      "how hungry he was. The pumpkin pasties seemed ages ago.\n",
      "Albus Dumbledore had gotten to his feet. He was beaming at the\n",

      "\"Mad?\" said Percy airily. \"He's a genius! Best wizard in the world! But\n",
      "he is a bit mad, yes. Potatoes, Harry?\"\n",
      "Harry's mouth fell open. The dishes in front of him were now piled with\n",
      "food. He had never seen so many things he liked to eat on one table: roast beef,\n",
      "roast chicken, pork chops and lamb chops, sausages, bacon and steak, boiled\n",
      "potatoes, roast potatoes, fries, Yorkshire pudding, peas, carrots, gravy, ketchup,\n",
      "and, for some strange reason, peppermint humbugs.\n",
      "The Dursleys had never exactly starved Harry, but he'd never been\n",
      "allowed to eat as much as he liked. Dudley had always taken anything that Harry\n",
      "really wanted, even if It made him sick. Harry piled his plate with a bit of\n",
      "everything except the peppermints and began to eat. It was all delicious.\n",
      "\"That does look good,\" said the ghost in the ruff sadly, watching Harry\n",
      "cut up his steak.\n",
      "\"Can't you?\"\n",
      "\"I haven't eaten for nearly five hundred years,\" said the ghost. \"I don't\n",

      "Sir Nicholas looked extremely miffed, as if their little chat wasn't going\n",
      "at all the way he wanted.\n",
      "\"Like this,\" he said irritably. He seized his left ear and pulled. His whole\n",
      "head swung off his neck and fell onto his shoulder as if it was on a hinge.\n",
      "Someone had obviously tried to behead him, but not done it properly. Looking\n",
      "pleased at the stunned looks on their faces, Nearly Headless Nick flipped his\n",

      "They had to study the night skies through their telescopes every\n",

      "of the planets. Three times a week they went out to the greenhouses behind the\n",
      "castle to study Herbology, with a dumpy little witch called Professor Sprout,\n",
      "where they learned how to take care of all the strange plants and fungi, and\n",
      "found out what they were used for. Easily the most boring class was History of\n",
      "Magic, which was the only one taught by a ghost. Professor Binns had been very\n",
      "old indeed when he had fallen asleep in front of the staff room fire and got up\n",
      "next morning to teach, leaving his body behind him. Binns droned on and on\n",
      "while they scribbled down names and dates, and got Emetic the Evil and Uric\n",

      "hung around the turban, and the Weasley twins insisted that it was stuffed full of\n",
      "garlic as well, so that Quirrell was protected wherever he went.\n",
      "Harry was very relieved to find out that he wasn't miles behind everyone\n",
      "else. Lots of people had come from Muggle families and, like him, hadn't had\n",
      "any idea that they were witches and wizards. There was so much to learn that\n",
      "even people like Ron didn't have much of a head start.\n",
      "Friday was an important day for Harry and Ron. They finally managed to\n",
      "find their way down to the Great Hall for breakfast without getting lost once.\n",
      "\"What have we got today?\" Harry asked Ron as he poured sugar on his\n",
      "porridge.\n",
      "\"Double Potions with the Slytherins,\" said Ron. \"Snape's Head of\n",
      "Slytherin House. They say he always favors them - we'll be able to see if it's\n",
      "true.\"\n",
      "\"Wish McGonagall favored us,\" said Harry. Professor McGonagall was\n",
      "head of Gryffindor House, but it hadn't stopped her from giving them a huge pile\n",
      "of homework the day before.\n",
      "Just then, the mail arrived. Harry had gotten used to this by now, but it\n",

      "had suddenly streamed into the Great Hall during breakfast, circling the tables\n",
      "until they saw their owners, and dropping letters and packages onto their laps.\n",

      "Hagrid\n",
      "Harry borrowed Ron's quill, scribbled Yes, please, see you later on the back\n",

      "It was lucky that Harry had tea with Hagrid to look forward to, because\n",
      "the Potions lesson turned out to be the worst thing that had happened to him so\n",
      "far.\n",
      "At the start-of-term banquet, Harry had gotten the idea that Professor\n",

      "wrong. Snape didn't dislike Harry - he hated him.\n",
      "Potions lessons took place down in one of the dungeons. It was colder\n",
      "here than up in the main castle, and would have been quite creepy enough\n",
      "without the pickled animals floating in glass jars all around the walls.\n",
      "Snape, like Flitwick, started the class by taking the roll call, and like\n",
      "Flitwick, he paused at Harry's name.\n",
      "\"Ah, Yes,\" he said softly, \"Harry Potter. Our new - celebrity.\"\n",
      "-\n",
      "Draco Malfoy and his friends Crabbe and Goyle sniggered behind their\n",
      "hands. Snape finished calling the names and looked up at the class. His eyes\n",
      "were black like Hagrid's, but they had none of Hagrid's warmth. They were cold\n",
      "and empty and made you think of dark tunnels.\n",
      "“You are here to learn the subtle science and exact art of potionmaking,”\n",
      "he began. He spoke in barely more than a whisper, but they caught every word\n",
      "- like Professor McGonagall, Snape had the gift of keeping a class silent\n",
      "without effort. \"As there is little foolish wand-waving here, many of you will\n",
      "hardly believe this is magic. I don't expect you will really understand the beauty\n",
      "of the softly simmering cauldron with its shimmering fumes, the delicate power\n",
      "of liquids that creep through human veins, bewitching the mind, ensnaring the\n",
      "senses....I can teach you how to bottle fame, brew glory, even stopper death\n",
      "if you aren't as big a bunch of dunderheads as I usually have to teach.”\n",
      "More silence followed this little speech. Harry and Ron exchanged looks\n",
      "with raised eyebrows. Hermione Granger was on the edge of her seat and looked\n",
      "desperate to start proving that she wasn't a dunderhead.\n",
      "\"Potter!\" said Snape suddenly. \"What would I get if I added powdered\n",
      "root of asphodel to an infusion of wormwood?\"\n",
      "Powdered root of what to an infusion of what? Harry glanced at Ron,\n",
      "who looked as stumped as he was; Hermione's hand had shot into the air.\n",
      "\"I don't know, sir,\" said Harry.\n",
      "Snape's lips curled into a sneer.\n",
      "\"Tut, tut fame clearly isn't everything.\"\n",

      "\"I don't know, sir.\"\n",

      "everything in One Thousand Magical Herbs and Fungi?\n",
      "Snape was still ignoring Hermione's quivering hand.\n",
      "\"What is the difference, Potter, between monkshood and wolfsbane?\"\n",
      "At this, Hermione stood up, her hand stretching toward the dungeon\n",
      "ceiling.\n",
      "\"I don't know,\" said Harry quietly. \"I think Hermione does, though, why\n",
      "don't you try her?\"\n",
      "A few people laughed; Harry caught Seamus's eye, and Seamus winked.\n",

       "[\"CHAPTER ONE\\nTHE BOY WHO LIVED\\nMr. and Mrs. Dursley, of number four, Privet Drive, were proud to say\\nthat they were perfectly normal, thank you very much. They were the last people\\nyou'd expect to be involved in anything strange or mysterious, because they just\\ndidn't hold with such nonsense.\\nMr. Dursley was the director of a firm called Grunnings, which made\\ndrills. He was a big, beefy man with hardly any neck, although he did have a\\nvery large mustache. Mrs. Dursley was thin and blonde and had nearly twice the\\nusual amount of neck, which came in very useful as she spent so much of her\\ntime craning over garden fences, spying on the neighbors. The Dursleys had a\\nsmall son called Dudley and in their opinion there was no finer boy anywhere.\\nThe Dursleys had everything they wanted, but they also had a secret, and\\ntheir greatest fear was that somebody would discover it. They didn’t think they\\ncould bear it if anyone found out about the Potters. Mrs. Potter was Mrs.\\nDursley's sister, but they hadn't met for several years; in fact, Mrs. Dursley\\npretended she didn't have a sister, because her sister and her good\",\n",

       " \"-nothing\\nhusband were as unDursleyish as it was possible to be. The Dursleys shuddered\\nto think what the neighbors would say if the Potters arrived in the street. The\\nDursleys knew that the Potters had a small son, too, but they had never even\\nseen him. This boy was another good reason for keeping the Potters away; they\\ndidn't want Dudley mixing with a child like that.\\nWhen Mr. and Mrs. Dursley woke up on the dull, gray Tuesday our story\\nstarts, there was nothing about the cloudy sky outside to suggest that strange and\\nmysterious things would soon be happening all over the country. Mr. Dursley\\nhummed as he picked out his most boring tie for work, and Mrs. Dursley\\ngossiped away happily as she wrestled a screaming Dudley into his high chair.\\nNone of them noticed a large, tawny owl flutter past the window.\\nAt half past eight, Mr. Dursley picked up his briefcase, pecked Mrs.\\nDursley on the cheek, and tried to kiss Dudley good\",\n",
       " '-bye but missed, because\\nDudley was now having a tantrum and throwing his cereal at the walls.\\n\"Little tyke,\" chortled Mr. Dursley as he left the house. He got into his car\\nand backed out of number four\\'s drive.\\nIt was on the corner of the street that he noticed the first sign of\\nsomething peculiar a cat reading a map. For a second, Mr. Dursley didn\\'t\\nrealize what he had seen ',\n",
       " \"- then he jerked his head around to look again. There\\nwas a tabby cat standing on the corner of Privet Drive, but there wasn't a map in\\nsight. What could he have been thinking of? It must have been a trick of the\\nlight. Mr. Dursley blinked and stared at the cat. It stared back. As Mr. Dursley\\ndrove around the corner and up the road, he watched the cat in his mirror. It was\\nnow reading the sign that said Privet Drive \",\n",
       " \"- no, looking at the sign; cats\\ncouldn't read maps or signs. Mr. Dursley gave himself a little shake and put the\\ncat out of his mind. As he drove toward town he thought of nothing except a\\nlarge order of drills he was hoping to get that day.\\nBut on the edge of town, drills were driven out of his mind by something\\nelse. As he sat in the usual morning traffic jam, he couldn't help noticing that\\nthere seemed to be a lot of strangely dressed people about. People in cloaks. Mr.\\nDursley couldn't bear people who dressed in funny clothes the getups you\\nsaw on young people! He supposed this was some stupid new fashion. He\\ndrummed his fingers on the steering wheel and his eyes fell on a huddle of these\\nweirdos standing quite close by. They were whispering excitedly together. Mr.\\nDursley was enraged to see that a couple of them weren't young at all; why, that\\nman had to be older than he was, and wearing an emerald\",\n",

If he hadn’t, he might have found it harder to concentrate on drills\\nthat morning.

He put the receiver back\\ndown and stroked his mustache, thinking...no, he was being stupid. Potter\\nwasn't such an unusual name. He was sure there were lots of people called Potter\\nwho had a son called Harry. Come to think of it, he wasn't even sure his nephew\\nwas called Harry. He'd never even seen the boy.

It was\\na few seconds before Mr. Dursley realized that the man was wearing a violet\\ncloak. He didn\\'t seem at all upset at being almost knocked to the ground. On the\\ncontrary, his face split into a wide smile and he said in a squeaky voice that made\\npassersby stare, \"Don\\'t be sorry, my dear sir, for nothing could upset me today!\\nRejoice, for You',\n",

She told him over dinner all\\nabout Mrs. Next Door\\'s problems with her daughter and how Dudley had\\nlearned a new word (\"Won\\'t!\"). Mr. Dursley tried to act normally.

He cleared his throat nervously. \"Er\\nPetunia, dear you haven\\'t heard from your sister lately, have you?\"\\nAs he had expected, Mrs. Dursley looked shocked and angry.

He\\nhad had it as long as he could remember, and the first question he could ever\\nremember asking his Aunt Petunia was how he had gotten it.\\n\"In the car crash when your parents died,\" she had said. “And don\\'t ask\\nquestions.\"\\nDon\\'t ask questions that was the first rule for a quiet life with the\\nDursleys.\\nUncle Vernon entered the kitchen as Harry was turning over the bacon.\\n\"Comb your hair!\" he barked, by way of a morning greeting.\\nAbout once a week, Uncle Vernon looked over the top of his newspaper\\nand shouted that Harry needed a haircut. Harry must have had more haircuts than\\nthe rest of the boys in his class put together, but it made no difference, his hair\\nsimply grew that way ',\n",
       " '- all over the place.\\nHarry was frying eggs by the time Dudley arrived in the kitchen with his\\nmother. Dudley looked a lot like Uncle Vernon. He had a large pink face, not\\nmuch neck, small, watery blue eyes, and thick blond hair that lay smoothly on\\nhis thick, fat head. Aunt Petunia often said that Dudley looked like a baby angel\\n',\n",
       " '- Harry often said that Dudley looked like a pig in a wig.\\nHarry put the plates of egg and bacon on the table, which was difficult as\\nthere wasn\\'t much room. Dudley, meanwhile, was counting his presents. His\\nface fell.\\n\"Thirty',\n",
       " '-six,\" he said, looking up at his mother and father. \"That\\'s two\\nless than last year.\"\\n\"Darling, you haven\\'t counted Auntie Marge\\'s present, see, it\\'s here\\nunder this big one from Mummy and Daddy.\"\\n\"All right, thirty',\n",
       " '-seven then,\" said Dudley, going red in the face. Harry,\\nwho could see a huge Dudley tantrum coming on, began wolfing down his bacon\\nas fast as possible in case Dudley turned the table over.\\nAunt Petunia obviously scented danger, too, because she said quickly,\\n\"And we\\'ll buy you another two presents while we\\'re out today. How\\'s that,\\npopkin? Two more presents. Is that all right\"\\nDudley thought for a moment. It looked like hard work. Finally he said\\nslowly, \"So I\\'ll have thirty...thirty...\\'\\n\"\"\\n\"Thirty',\n",
       " '-nine, sweetums,\" said Aunt Petunia.\\n\"Oh.\" Dudley sat down heavily and grabbed the nearest parcel. \"All right\\nUncle Vernon chuckled.\\n\"Little tyke wants his money\\'s worth, just like his father. \\'Atta boy,\\nDudley!\" He ruffled Dudley\\'s hair.\\nthen.\"\\nAt that moment the telephone rang and Aunt Petunia went to answer it\\nwhile Harry and Uncle Vernon watched Dudley unwrap the racing bike, a video\\ncamera, a remote control airplane, sixteen new computer games, and a VCR. He\\nwas ripping the paper off a gold wristwatch when Aunt Petunia came back from\\nthe telephone looking both angry and worried.\\n\"Bad news, Vernon,\" she said. “Mrs. Figg\\'s broken her leg. She can\\'t\\ntake him.\" She jerked her head in Harry\\'s direction.\\nDudley\\'s mouth fell open in horror, but Harry\\'s heart gave a leap. Every\\nyear on Dudley\\'s birthday, his parents took him and a friend out for the day, to\\nadventure parks, hamburger restaurants, or the movies. Every year, Harry was\\nleft behind with Mrs. Figg, a mad old lady who lived two streets away. Harry\\nhated it there. The whole house smelled of cabbage and Mrs. Figg made him\\nlook at photographs of all the cats she\\'d ever owned.\\n\"Now what?\" said Aunt Petunia, looking furiously at Harry as though\\nhe’d planned this. Harry knew he ought to feel sorry that Mrs. Figg had broken\\nher leg, but it wasn\\'t easy when he reminded himself it would be a whole year\\nbefore he had to look at Tibbles, Snowy, Mr. Paws, and Tufty again.\\n\"We could phone Marge,\" Uncle Vernon suggested.\\n\"Don\\'t be silly, Vernon, she hates the boy.\"\\nThe Dursleys often spoke about Harry like this, as though he wasn\\'t there\\n',\n",
       " '- or rather, as though he was something very nasty that couldn\\'t understand\\nthem, like a slug.\\n\"What about what\\'s',\n",
       " '-her-name, your friend - Yvonne?\"\\n-']"
